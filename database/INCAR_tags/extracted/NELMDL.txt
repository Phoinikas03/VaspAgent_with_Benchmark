<p><a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a> = [integer] 
</p>
<p>Description: <a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a> specifies the number of non-self-consistent steps at the beginning.
</p>
<p>If the orbitals are initialized using a random number generator (the default in VASP),  the initial orbitals are usually unreasonable and the iterative matrix diagonalization will require 5-10 steps to obtain reasonable orbitals. The charge density corresponding to the initial orbitals is also, at best, erratic. It is hence advisable to perform a few electronic steps while keeping the initial Hamiltonian fixed. This initial Hamiltonian is usually determined from a superposition of atomic charge densities (see <a href="/wiki/index.php/ICHARG" title="ICHARG">ICHARG</a>).
</p>
<p>Such a 'delay' is absolutely necessary if the SCF-convergence is slow and problematic (e.g. for surfaces or metallic clusters, low dimensional system). Without a delay, VASP will most likely not converge, or at least the convergence speed is slowed significantly.
</p>
<p><a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a> might be set to a positive or negative value. A negative value means that the delay is only performed in the first ionic step (usually the recommended option). A positive number means that a delay is employed after each ionic movement. This can improve the convergence speed in VASP.6 (see below) but is not recommended in VASP.5.
</p>
<p>For calculations using a direct minimization of the Hamiltonian (<a href="/wiki/index.php/ALGO" title="ALGO">ALGO</a>=ALL  or <a href="/wiki/index.php/ALGO" title="ALGO">ALGO</a>=DAMPED), the Davidson algorithm is used during the delay phase and the Hamiltonian is kept fixed during these steps. 
</p>
<p>Special considerations for VASP.6:
</p>
<ul><li>For calculations using a direct minimization of the Hamiltonian (<a href="/wiki/index.php/ALGO" title="ALGO">ALGO</a>=ALL or <a href="/wiki/index.php/ALGO" title="ALGO">ALGO</a>=DAMPED): if <a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a> is set, the Davidson algorithm is used in the first <a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a> steps as described above. Using a positive <a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a> (i.e. delay in every ionic step) does not work reliably in VASP.5, due to issues in the orbital and charge density prediction. In VASP.6, using <a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a>=1 (or <a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a>=2) and direct minimization often improves the stability and efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations or relaxations (<a href="/wiki/index.php/ALGO" title="ALGO">ALGO</a>=ALL or <a href="/wiki/index.php/ALGO" title="ALGO">ALGO</a>=DAMPED). Note, however, that this might require one to prepare a reasonable <a href="/wiki/index.php/WAVECAR" title="WAVECAR">WAVECAR</a> file since <a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a> =1/2 might not suffice to obtain a reasonable set of orbitals from the initial random numbers.</li></ul>
<ul><li>For HF-type calculations, if <a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a> is larger or equal to 3, VASP will perform  <a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a> non-selfconsistent steps using the Davidson algorithm, and a local Hamiltonian is calculated using the semi-local DFT functional corresponding to the chosen hybrid functional (i.e. PBE for HSE and PBE0). This is expedient if the ions move by a large distance between the ionic steps. Setting  <a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a> =3 can thus improve the stability and performance during relaxations using HF-type Hamiltonians. Try to use <a href="/wiki/index.php/ALGO" title="ALGO">ALGO</a>=All and <a class="mw-selflink selflink">NELMDL</a>=3 if you encounter convergence issues during relaxations using HF-type Hamiltonians.</li></ul>
