<p>Description: Controls the overlap in communication. 
</p>
<p>If <a class="mw-selflink selflink">LASYNC</a>=<i>.TRUE.</i> is set in the INCAR file, VASP will try to overlap communication with calculations.
This might improve performance or degrade it depending on the MPI library and hardware you are running on.
Please do your own testing and compare the runtimes and results before using this tag in production runs.
Compiling VASP using the <a href="/wiki/index.php/Precompiler_options#-DPROFILING" title="Precompiler options">-DPROFILING</a> precompiler switch provides a detailed timing of the different VASP routines which helps in determining if there is a performance gain.
