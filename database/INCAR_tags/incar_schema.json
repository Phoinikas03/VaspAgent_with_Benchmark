The number of electrons is determined automatically from the POTCAR (ZVAL of the element) and POSCAR file (number of the atoms of the respective atom type) assuming the cell is charge-neutral. If the number of electrons is not compatible with the number derived from the valence and the number of atoms a homogeneous background charge is assumed. If the number of ions specified in the POSCAR file is 0 and NELECT =n, then the energy of a homogeneous electron gas is calculated. Charged calculations The required first-order correction to the energy caused by an excess charge is given by where q is the net charge of the system, alpha the Madelung constant of a point charge q placed in a homogeneous background charge -q , and \u03b5 the dielectric constant of the system. For atoms or molecules surrounded by vacuum, \u03b5 takes on the vacuum value \u03b5=1. VASP can automatically correct this leading error, see Electrostatic corrections for further information. It is important to emphasize that the total energy cannot be corrected for charged slabs, since a charged slab results in an electrostatic potential that grows with the distance from the slab. This non-convergence of the potential is a result of the interaction between the charged slab and the compensating background. A practical consequence of this non-convergence is that the total energy depends linearly on the width of the vacuum.

    "description": "BANDGAP determines the verbosity for reporting the bandgap to the OUTCAR file. Only the first character is significant. The bandgap of the system separates the occupied valence bands from the unoccupied conduction bands. Of particular interest are the fundamental bandgap between valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) and the direct bandgap at a single k point. BANDGAP controls how VASP reports the bandgap information. The following options exist: BANDGAP =COMPACT BANDGAP =WEIGHT BANDGAP =KPOINT Difference between WEIGHT and KPOINT The figure illustrates different possible properties of electronic band structures. For semiconductors, the bandgap is well defined so that the choice of BANDGAP only affects whether the output is compact or verbose. For metals, there is no straightforward definition of a bandgap so the default of BANDGAP =COMPACT is sufficient. A semimetal shares properties with metals (Fermi energy crosses bands) and with semiconductors (visible bandgap in the band structure). BANDGAP =WEIGHT interprets systems like a metal; valence (conduction) states are more (less) than half-filled. In this case, the bandgap of a semimetal converges to zero with an increasing number of k points similar to a metal. For N number of electrons, the number of valence states is not in general equal to N for all k points. Hence, the direct bandgap is not necessarily between the N-th and the (N + 1)-th state. BANDGAP =KPOINT considers systems like a semiconductor where every k point may be treated individually. The number of valence bands is equal to the number of electrons N for all k points and the direct bandgap is equal to the smallest difference between the N-th and (N + 1)-th state. In a semimetal, this approach produces a negative bandgap because the Fermi energy crosses the bands. For collinear calculations ( ISPIN =2), this method will allow for a different number of up and down electrons at every k point. Example of the verbose output The column spin independent is always present and reports the bandgap ignoring the spin of the electron. The other two columns are only visible for ISPIN =2 and describe the bandgap for a given spin of the electron. The first block of rows show the band edges of the fundamental bandgap and their corresponding k -point coordinates. The second block reports analogous values for the direct gap. In each case the energy difference of the band edges is computed and printed as fundamental and direct gap, respectively. Related tags and articles EFERMI , ISMEAR , SIGMA Examples that use this tag"

Note that the partial occupancies are also written to the OUTCAR file Keep in mind that for systems without spin-polarization the occupations are twice as large in the OUTCAR file than what you should provide for FERWE because of spin degeneracy. You can use FERWE to keep occupancies fixed during ionic relaxations or molecular dynamics simulations. However, keeping the orbital occupancies fixed, requires that the orbital order does not change during the self-consistency cycle or during the optimization of the orbitals. Imagine, for instance, that the eigenenergy of the 65th orbital moves below the orbital energy of the 64th orbital. By default, VASP will order the eigenenergies so that enforcing FERWE will move the electrons to the originally unoccupied 65th orbital because it has now the lower energy.

It makes sense to include them for accurate calculations with hard potentials ( *_h ) on systems containing also (non-hydrogen) atoms from the top rows of the periodic table (B, C, N, O, F), typically with short bonds, e.g. C 2 H 2 , where effects up to a few ppm are possible. Effects are most significant for the H shift. For such systems using standard potentials typically introduces larger inaccuracies. The two-center contributions are calculated using a multipole expansion of the current density that is represented on the plane wave grid; as in Sec. III.A.3 of. Ref.  . The relevance of LLRAUG to achieve basis-set completeness for shieldings is discussed in Ref.  that compares to basis-set converged quantum chemical calculations  .

For instance, to perform the projection onto a hydrogen-like 1s function on the first ionic position specified in the POSCAR file, the tag reads Specifying the local basis <sites> : The sites on which the local functions are centered. <functions-Ylm-specs> : The angular character of the local functions on the specified sites. <functions-radial-specs> : The radial dependency of the local functions. For instance, performs the projection onto a hydrogen-like 2s function and a d xy pseudo partial wave (2 nd d channel of atomic species 3) on ionic site 1, and a d xy pseudo partial wave (identical type) on site 3. For other tags, the second instance of a tag in the INCAR is normally ignored. However, here is possible. Example for LOCPROJ tag As mentioned above, to put a hydrogen-like 1s function on the first ionic position specified in the POSCAR file, the tag reads in the INCAR file. To change this into a 2s function, specify To project the orbitals onto the PAW projectors of the valence atomic d xy -states of the atoms on sites 1 and 3, write This will only work if the atoms on these sites have valence atomic d -states. Otherwise, the necessary projectors will not be available in the relevant PAW datasets, and the code will exit in error at startup. To forcibly use the radial function of the second d channel, write Again, provided the PAW dataset(s) contain more than one d channel. Similarly, one can project onto the pseudo partial waves of the second d channel in the PAW dataset(s) by writing To project onto the functions of the third PAW dataset in the POTCAR file, specify LOCPROJ file The LOCPROJ file contains information about the projections of the Bloch states onto the localized orbitals specified with the LOCPROJ tag described above.

Radial type: Is one of \"PAW projector\",\"PS partial wave\", \"Hydrogen-like\" depending on the choice of Pr , Ps or Hy , respectively. Angular type: Angular character of the local functions, as presented in the table above in <functions-Ylm-specs> .

To alleviate this issue and improve the convergence of the exact exchange integral with respect to supercell size (or k-point mesh density) different methods have been proposed: the auxiliary function methods  , probe-charge Ewald  ( HFALPHA ), and Coulomb truncation methods  ( HFRCUT ). These mostly involve modifying the Coulomb Kernel in a way that yields the same result as the unmodified kernel within the limit of large supercell sizes. These corrections are implemented in VASP either by changing the {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G}=0} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G}=0} component of the Coulomb kernel when FOCKCORR =1 with {\\displaystyle \\chi} {\\displaystyle \\chi} being the value of the correction and depends on whether HFALPHA or HFRCUT are set, or by including the original orbital scaled by the convergence correction when FOCKCORR =2 For Hartree-Fock or hybrid functional calculations, either FOCKCORR =1 or FOCKCORR =2 can be used and should yield the same results when LMAXFOCKAE =-1 and there are no aliasing errors in the exact exchange (see PRECFOCK for more details). For post-DFT methods such as ACDFT, GW, and BSE the FOCKCORR =2 should be used because the overlap densities are reconstructed in the plane-wave grid (see LMAXFOCKAE tag).

In this case, it is expedient to supply different INCAR and POSCAR files in each subdirectory 01, 02, 03, ..., nn. For each subdiretory a different simulation temperature should be supplied using the tags TEBEG in the INCAR files 01/INCAR, 02/INCAR ... nn/INCAR.

    "description": "PRECFOCK controls the FFT grids used in the exact exchange routines (Hartree-Fock and hybrid functionals). The FFT grid used for the exact exchange contributions can be chose to be different from the one used for the Hartree and DFT potentials. Information on the FFT grid that is used in the exact Fock exchange routines is written to the OUTCAR file after the lines We recommend to set PRECFOCK =Normal for routine calculations. If speed is an issue, you can also use PRECFOCK =Fast (e.g. use this to pre-converge the orbitals). For very high precision, in particular for phonon calculations, PRECFOCK =Accurate is recommended. The two setting, PRECFOCK =Medium and PRECFOCK =Low are not recommended, but have been kept to maintain compatibility with older VASP versions. Generally, as opposed to gradient corrected density functionals, the exact exchange energy is rather insensitive to the FFT grids, and in many cases a rather coarse grid can be used to calculate the overlap densities and the exact exchange (Fock) potential. Exact exchange requires one to evaluation the overlap density between two orbitals. Strictly speaking, errors in the convolution (aliasing errors) are only avoided, if the FFT grid contains all Fourier components up to twice the plane wave with the largest wave vector, 2|G cut |. As usual, |G cut | is determined by the plane wave cutoff ( ENCUT ). A grid avoiding aliasing errors is chosen by setting PRECFOCK =Accurate. In this case, the FFT grid for the exact exchange is identical to the FFT grid used for the orbitals for PREC =Accurate in the DFT part. PRECFOCK =Accurate is the recommended setting for very accurate calculations. For PRECFOCK =Low and Fast, the smallest possible FFT grid that just encloses the cutoff sphere (G cut |) is used. This accelerates the calculations by roughly a factor two to three, but causes slight errors in the total energies and some noise in the calculated forces. To reduce the noise, the augmentation charges are made very soft for PRECFOCK =Fast (whereas PRECFOCK =Low uses the standard augmentation charges also used for DFT). For PRECFOCK =Normal, the FFT grid for the exact exchange is identical to the FFT grid used for the orbitals for PREC =Normal in the DFT part. In this case, the grid density is between the ones for PRECFOCK =Accurate and PRECFOCK =Fast. This is often a very reasonable comprise and hence recommended for most routine calculations. For PRECFOCK =Fast, Normal and Accurate, the augmentation charges (required to restore the norm and dipoles of the overlap density on the plane wave grid) are softened, such that an accurate presentation on the plane wave grid is possible even for relatively coarse FFT grids. The sphere size is printed out after Since VASP always uses one-center terms to correct for the difference between all-electron and pseudo orbitals, the precise shape of the augmentation charges matters little for exchange energies. Still it is recommended to keep PRECFOCK and PREC the same if relative energies are calculated (for instance adsorption energies, energies differences between different phases, etc.). The following table summarizes the possible setting: Medium and Single are synonyms. They are useful the select the same treatment for the Hartree and exchange term. This can be advantageously for correlated wave function calculations to obtain a numerically exact balance and compensation between Hartree and exchange (for instance for the upcoming auxiliary field Monte-Carlo module in VASP). For conventional Hartree-Fock or hybrid functional calculations, Normal or Accurate should be used. In this table, G cut is determined by the relation with E cut = ENCUT . Even PRECFOCK =Fast yields fairly low noise in the forces and virtually no egg-box effects (aliasing errors). In the forces, the noise is usually below 0.01 eV/Angstrom. For PRECFOCK =N and PRECFOCK =A, noise is usually not an issue, and the accuracy is sufficient even for phonon calculations in large supercells. Any combination of PREC and PRECFOCK is allowed by the code. Useful settings of increasing precision are however: Related tags and articles PREC , ENCUT , List of hybrid functionals , Hybrid functionals: formalism Examples that use this tag"

Setting or equivalently determines the RPA total energy with corresponding forces and the quasiparticle energies within the GW approximation. The LRPAFORCE tag can be used in combination with the standard relaxation options IBRION and NSW as explained in the corresponding RPA calculations guide . Generally, the energy calculated by the RPA can be quite noisy as a function of the ionic positions, in particular, if PRECFOCK = FAST and NMAXFOCKAE = 1 is set (these are the default values for RPA calculations). Most of the noise is related to the exact exchange energy, and we are working on methods to improve this issue. Currently, to reduce the noise in the energy and forces, it is sensible to set PRECFOCK = Normal (typically doubling the execution time and memory requirement). It is also possible to set LMAXFOCKAE = -1 (which implicitly sets NMAXFOCKAE = 0). This makes the correlation energies and the related forces less noisy, but technically less accurate (i.e. part of the correlation energy will be missing at high transition energies). Overall, RPA forces must be used carefully and only after extensive testing of all relevant parameters.

This tag sets the interval in units of molecular-dynamics steps at which the error estimates are written to the ML_LOGFILE . The error estimate is computed by utilizing the spilling factor if a refit with ML_MODE = REFIT was done. The spilling factor is calculated for each atom in the current structure and the maximum among all atoms is written to the ML_LOGFILE file marked with SFF . The spilling factor measures the similarity of the local environment of each atom in the current structure to that of the local reference configurations of the force field. The values of the spilling factor are in the range {\\displaystyle } {\\displaystyle } . If the atomic environment is \"properly\" represented by the local reference configurations the spilling factor approaches 0. Vice versa the spilling factor quickly approaches 1, if the force field is extrapolating. The calculation of the spilling factor scales quadratically with the number of local reference configurations and linearly with the number of species. For force fields containing many species and/or local reference configurations, the evaluation time of the spilling factor becomes of the order of the evaluation of a single force field step or more. Since it is sufficient to monitor the error every ML_IERR MD steps, the total time consumed by the evaluation of the spilling factor can become insignificantly compared to the total time. In long molecular dynamics calculations, we recommend to use at least ML_IERR =20-100. ML_IERR can be freely chosen only if ML_MODE = RUN . In any other calculation mode, if ML_IERR is not equal to 1, the code will exit with an error and provide an error description. For calculations using force fields obtained by ML_MODE = REFITBAYESIAN or without any refitting, the Bayesian error estimates of energy, forces and stress ( BEFF ) are additionally written out to the ML_LOGFILE file and their output frequency is also controlled by ML_IERR . Albeit having the advantage of an additional error estimate we still do not recommend using these force fields, since they are significantly slower than force fields obtained by ML_MODE = REFIT .

The nonlocal part of the pseudopotential requires the evaluation of an expression: where the \"projected wavefunction character\" is defined as: This expression can be evaluated in reciprocal or real space: In reciprocal space (second line), the number of operations scales with the size of the basis set, i.e., number of plane waves. In real space (first line), the projection operators are confined to spheres around each atom. Therefore, the number of operations necessary to evaluate one C in k does not increase with the system size (usually, the number of grid points within the cutoff sphere is between 500 and 2000). One of the major obstacles to the method working in real space is that the projection operators must be optimized, i.e., all high Fourier components must be removed from the projection operators. If this is not done, aliasing can happen, i.e., the high Fourier components of the projection operators are downfolded to low Fourier components, and random noise is introduced). Currently, VASP supports three different schemes to remove the high Fourier components from the projectors. LREAL =.TRUE. is the simplest one. For LREAL =.TRUE., the real-space projectors that the pseudopotential generation code has generated are used. This requires no user interference but is potentially very inaccurate. For the outdated LREAL =On, the real space projectors are optimized by VASP using an algorithm proposed by King-Smith et al.  For the recommended LREAL =Auto, an unpublished scheme  is used which results in simultaneously more accurate and localized projector functions than for the King-Smith et al. method. To fine-tune the optimization procedure, the tag ROPT can and should be used, if LREAL =Auto (or LREAL =On) is used. Specifically, perform first reference calculations using LREAL =.False. and decrease ROPT until an acceptable accuracy, e.g., 1 meV/atom, is attained. Please also check carefully the documentation for ROPT . We recommend using the real-space projection scheme for systems containing more than about 30 atoms. We also strongly recommend using only LREAL =Auto. For LREAL =A (and LREAL =O) the projection operators are optimized by VASP on the fly (i.e. on startup). Several tags influence the optimization: ENCUT (i.e., the energy cutoff), components beyond the energy cutoff are 'removed' from the projection operators.

ML_IALGO_LINREG =4 gives more stable force fields and better fitting accuracy than ML_IALGO_LINREG =3, due to the regularization term employed (for details please see here ). ML_IALGO_LINREG =4 dramatically improves the condition number of the fitting compared to ML_IALGO_LINREG =1 since it directly uses the design matrix. In contrast ML_IALGO_LINREG =1 requires to use the covariance matrix (square of the design matrix), which effectively doubles the condition number. However, ML_IALGO_LINREG =4 needs significantly more memory than ML_IALGO_LINREG =1 (at least twice that much). Please always monitor the memory estimates in the ML_LOGFILE ! It should be also noted that ML_IALGO_LINREG =4 is computationally somewhat more demanding than ML_IALGO_LINREG =1, but it typically requires between a few minutes and an hour. So usually the extra cost is negligible compared to the original training.

    "description": "OMEGAMAX specifies the maximum frequency for the dense part of the frequency grid for GW calculations (old GW code, does not apply to GWR). For CRPA calculations, OMEGAMAX is the frequency point of the interaction. For BSE calculations OMEGAMAX determines the maximum energy difference for excitation pairs to be included. Since the flag controls different aspects of the code, be careful when setting it (and remember to remove the tag, when you change the type of calculations). GW type calculations: For the frequency grid along the real and imaginary axis sophisticated schemes are used, which are based on simple model functions for the macroscopic dielectric function. The grid spacing is dense up to roughly 1.3* OMEGAMAX and becomes coarser for larger frequencies. The default value for OMEGAMAX is either determined by the outermost node in the dielectric function (corresponding to a singularity in the inverse of the dielectric function) or the energy difference between the valence band minimum and the conduction band minimum. The larger of these two values is used. Except for pseudopotentials with deep lying core states, OMEGAMAX is usually determined by the node in the dielectric function. For ACFDT calculations , only OMEGAMIN and OMEGATL determine the frequency grid (using a minimax algorithm). The defaults have been carefully tested, and it is recommended to leave them unmodified, whenever possible. The grid should be solely controlled by NOMEGA . The only other value that can be modified is the complex shift CSHIFT . In principle, CSHIFT should NOT be chosen independently of NOMEGA and OMEGAMAX : e.g. for less dense grids (smaller NOMEGA ) the complex shift must be accordingly increased. The default for CSHIFT has been chosen such that the calculations are converged to 10 meV with respect to NOMEGA : i.e. if CSHIFT is kept constant and NOMEGA is increased, the QP shifts should not change by more than 10 meV; at least for LSPECTRAL = .TRUE.. This was the case for the considered test materials. For LSPECTRAL = .FALSE. this does not apply. In this case it is recommended to set CSHIFT manually and to perform careful convergence tests. For LSPECTRAL = .TRUE. independent convergence tests with respect to NOMEGA and CSHIFT are usually not required, and it should be sufficient to control the technical parameters via the single parameter NOMEGA . Also note that too large values for NOMEGA in combination with coarse k-point grids can cause a decrease in precision (see NOMEGA ). BSE and TD-DFT type calculations (see BSE calculations ): In this case, OMEGAMAX allows to reduce the number of conduction/ valence band pairs. Usually these are determined by NBANDSV and NBANDSO . The number of pairs is roughly proportional to the products of NBANDSV , NBANDSO , and the number of k-points in the full Brillouin zone. If OMEGAMAX is set, pairs for which the difference of the independent particle energy is larger than OMEGAMAX will be removed from the basis set (and from the BSE calculations). This can improve performance, without significantly affecting the imaginary part of the dielectric function. The real part of the dielectric function is, however, rather sensitive to reducing OMEGAMAX , NBANDSV , NBANDSO .

The binding energy of core electrons {\\displaystyle E_{CL}} {\\displaystyle E_{CL}} is given as Here, {\\displaystyle E(n_{c})} {\\displaystyle E(n_{c})} is the energy from a standard density-functional calculation in which the number of core electrons corresponds to the unexcited ground state. {\\displaystyle E(n_{c}-1)} {\\displaystyle E(n_{c}-1)} is the energy of a calculation where one electron is removed from the core of one particular atom and added to the valence or conduction band. The core-level binding energies can be calculated either in the initial-state approximation or the final-state approximation. In the initial-state approximation, a core electron is removed from the core states and added to the valence/conduction bands but no change of the potential (by e.g. relaxation of the valence electrons) is allowed. The core-level binding energy can then be directly calculated by the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues   of the core level {\\displaystyle \\epsilon_{c}} {\\displaystyle \\epsilon_{c}} and the Fermi energy {\\displaystyle \\epsilon_{F}} {\\displaystyle \\epsilon_{F}} In the final-state approximation, the electrons (valence electrons in the frozen-core approximation) are allowed to relax, so that the local hole is screened. In other words, a fully self-consistent electronic calculation is carried out with a core hole and an additional electron in the valence/conduction bands. The following options are available in VASP: ICORELEVEL =0: The core energies are not calculated (default). ICORELEVEL =1: The initial-state approximation is used. This just involves recalculating the KS eigenvalues of the core states after a self-consistent calculation of the valence charge density. ICORELEVEL =1 is a little bit more involved than the calculations using LVTOT = .TRUE. , since the Kohn-Sham energy of each core state is recalculated. This adds very little extra cost to the calculations. Usually, the shifts correspond very closely to the change of the electrostatic potential at the lattice sites (calculated using LVTOT = .TRUE. ). ICORELEVEL =2: The final-state approximation is used. Electrons are removed from the core and placed into the valence (effectively increasing NELECT ). The VASP implementation excites all selected core electrons for all atoms of one species. The species, as well as the selected electrons, are specified using The electron count CLZ specifies how many electrons are excited from the core. Usually, 1 or 0.5 (Slater's transition state) are sensible choices. CLNT selects for which species in the POTCAR file the electrons are excited. Usually one would like to excite the electrons for only one atom, this requires changing the POSCAR and POTCAR file, such that the selected atom corresponds to one species in the POTCAR file. i.e. if the calculation invokes a supercell with 64 atoms of one type, the selected atom needs to be singled out, and the POSCAR file will then contain 63 \"standard\" atoms as well as one special species, at which the excited core hole will be placed (the POTCAR file will hold two identical PAW datasets in this case). Several caveats apply to this mode. First, the excited electron is always spherical and multipole splittings are not available. Second, the other core electrons are not allowed to relax, which might cause a slight error in the calculated energies. Third, absolute energies are not meaningful, since VASP usually reports valence energies only. Only relative shifts of the core electron binding energies are relevant (in some cases, the VASP total energies might become even positive). Super-cell core-hole method ICORELEVEL =2 and itss related tags are necessary for the calculation of X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) using the super-cell core-hole method.

The imaginary part is determined by a summation over empty states using the equation: here the indices c and v refer to conduction and valence band states respectively, and u c k is the cell periodic part of the orbitals at the k-point k . The real part of the dielectric tensor \u03b5 (1) is obtained by the usual Kramers-Kronig transformation where P denotes the principle value. The method is explained in detail in the paper by Gajdo\u0161 et al. (see Eqs. 15, 29, and 30).  The complex shift \u03b7 is determined by the parameter CSHIFT . Note that local field effects, i.e. changes of the cell periodic part of the potential are neglected in this approximation. These can be evaluated using either the implemented density functional perturbation theory ( LEPSILON =.TRUE.), or the GW routines. The method selected using LOPTICS =.TRUE. requires an appreciable number of empty conduction band states. Reasonable results are usually only obtained, if the parameter NBANDS is roughly doubled or tripled in the INCAR file with respect to the VASP default. Furthermore it is emphasized that the routine works properly even for HF and screened exchange type calculations and hybrid functionals . In this case, finite differences are used to determine the derivatives of the Hamiltonian with respect to k . Note that the number of frequency grid points is determined by the parameter NEDOS . In many cases it is desirable to increase this parameter significantly from its default value. Values around NEDOS =2000 are strongly recommended. VASP posses multiple other routines to calculate the frequency dependent dielectric function. Specifically, one can use ALGO = TDHF (Casida/ BSE calculations ), ALGO = GW ( GW calculations ) and ALGO = TIMEEV ( Time Evolution : apply a delta kick and follow the induced dipoles). Compared to LOPTICS =.TRUE., all those routines have the advantage to include effects beyond the independent particle approximation, however, they are usually also much more expensive than LOPTICS =.TRUE. Spectral broadening The dielectric function calculated with LOPTICS includes broadening due to the smearing method ISMEAR and the Lorentzian broadening due to the complex shift in the Kramers-Kronig transformation. For example, the combination of LOPTICS =.TRUE. and ISMEAR =0 produces the dielectric function broadened by a Gaussian with the width SIGMA and a Lorentzian with the width CSHIFT . To avoid using two different broadening methods imultaneously and only include the Lorentzian broadening, one should set SIGMA to a much smaller value than CSHIFT .

    "description": "SPRING gives the spring constant between the images as used in the elastic band method. SPRING has to be set together with IMAGES if the elastic band method is used to calculate energy barriers between two ionic configurations of a system. For SPRING = 0, each image is only allowed to move into the direction perpendicular to the current hyper-tangent, which is calculated as the normal vector between two neighboring images. This algorithm keeps the distance between the images constant to first order . It is therefore possible to start with a dense image spacing around the saddle point to obtain a finer resolution around this point. The nudged elastic band method   is applied when SPRING is set to a negative value e.g. This is also the recommended setting. Compared to the previous case, additional tangential springs are introduced to keep the images equidistant during the relaxation (remember the constraint is only conserved to first order otherwise). Do not use too large values, because this can slow down convergence. The default value usually works quite reliably. One problem of the nudged elastic band method is that the constraint (i.e movements only in the hyper-plane perpendicular to the current tangent) is non linear. Therefore, the CG algorithm usually fails to converge, and we recommended to use the RMM-DIIS algorithm ( IBRION =1) or the quick-min algorithm ( IBRION =3). Additionally, the non-linear constraint (equidistant images) tends to be violated significantly during the first few steps (it is only enforced to first order). If this problem is encountered, a very low dimensionality parameter ( IBRION =1, NFREE =2) should be applied in the first few steps, or a steepest descent minimization without line optimization ( IBRION =3, SMASS =2). should be used, to pre-converge the images.

Our experience suggests that choosing ENCUTGW = 2/3 ENCUT yields reasonable results at fairly modest computational cost, although, the response function contains contributions up to twice the plane wave cutoff {\\displaystyle G_{\\rm cut}} {\\displaystyle G_{\\rm cut}} , see ALGO tag. Furthermore, RPA correlation energies are reported using an internal extrapolation of the correlation energy by varying the value of ENCUTGW inside VASP between the largest value given in the INCAR file and smaller values  . Mind: The extrapolated value is only reliable, if ENCUTGW is smaller then ENCUT . The cutoff extrapolation with respect to ENCUTGW would be precise if the plane wave basis for the orbitals were infinite. Again, the VASP defaults yield very reasonable values for the extrapolated correlation energy. In fact, it is unwise to increase ENCUTGW only, without increasing ENCUT . To converge RPA correlation energies, simply increase ENCUT and the number of orbitals, and use the VASP default for ENCUTGW . For quasiparticle (QP) bandgaps, it is sometimes possible to set ENCUTGW to values between 150 to 200 eV, and even 100 eV can yield gaps that are accurate to within a few tens of an eV for main group elements. Be aware, however, that the absolute values of the QP energies depend inverse proportionally on the number of plane waves. Thus, the convergence of absolute QP energies is very slow, although QP gaps might seem converged. The recommended procedure to obtain accurate QP energies is discussed in the reference below. Specifically, for reference type calculations we recommend the following procedure: Use the default for ENCUTGW , or even decrease ENCUTGW to half the value of ENCUT . Calculate all orbitals that the plane-wave basis set allows to calculate. This number can be determined by searching for \"maximum number of plane-waves\" in the ground-state DFT OUTCAR file, and setting NBANDS to this value. Increase ENCUT systematically and plot the QP energies versus the number of plane-wave coefficients, which equals the number of orbitals. This means ENCUTGW and NBANDS increase as ENCUT increases. This procedure can be carried out using few k points. Other commonly applied methods can yield less accurate results and are not considered to be reliable. FFT grid and PRECFOCK The PRECFOCK tag determines the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) grid in all GW (and Hartree-Fock) related routines. For small systems, the computational time is often dominated by FFT operations. Therefore, the PRECFOCK tag can have a significant impact on the compute time for QP calculations. For large systems, the FFT's usually do not dominate the computational workload, and savings are expected to be small for PRECFOCK = fast . QP shifts are usually not very sensitive to the setting of PRECFOCK and therefore there is no harm in setting PRECFOCK = fast ), whereas for RPA calculations we recommend to set PRECFOCK = normal to avoid numerical errors. Related tags and articles PRECFOCK , ENCUT , ENCUTGWSOFT , GW calculations , Basis set convergence Examples that use this tag Further reading Generally, QP energies converge like one over the number of orbitals and one over the number of plane waves in the response function. For basis set converged calculations, we recommend using the strategies outlined in Ref.  , which contains a comprehensive study of the performance of the convergence of GW calculations. References"

The default value for ML_MODE = REFIT works reliably in most calculations, however, sometimes it is necessary to increase the regularization parameter to avoid instabilities during finite temperature molecular dynamics simulations. Suppose the regularization needs to be controlled manually, like e.g. in the fitting via singular value decomposition ( ML_MODE = REFIT or ML_IALGO_LINREG =4). The best is to control the regularization via this parameter and keep the noise parameter {\\displaystyle s_{\\mathrm{v}}} {\\displaystyle s_{\\mathrm{v}}} (see ML_SIGV0 ) constant at 1. Useful values for ML_SIGW0 are typically between 1E-1 and 1E-9. When the value is increased the regularization is increased. This often slightly increases the training set error but also reduces potential instabilities. Hence, if instabilities are observed during molecular-dynamics simulations, one should try to increase ML_SIGW0 to say 1E-3, then refit, and repeat the molecular-dynamics simulations.

    "description": "ISYM determines the way VASP treats symmetry. ISYM =1 | 2 | 3, switches on the use of symmetry. For ISYM =-1 | 0, the use of symmetry is switched off. For ISYM =2 a more efficient, memory conserving symmetrization of the charge density is used (than for ISYM =1). This reduces memory requirements in particular for the parallel version. For ISYM =3, VASP does not directly symmetrize the charge density. Instead, the charge density is constructed by applying the relevant symmetry operations to the orbitals at the k -points in the irreducible part of the Brillouin zone. This method of symmetrization is used when LHFCALC =.TRUE. For ISYM =0, VASP does not use symmetry, but it will assume that \u03a8 k =\u03a8 * -k and reduces the sampling of the Brillouin zone accordingly. This value should be set for molecular dynamics, i.e. IBRION =0. For ISYM =-1 the use of symmetry is switched off completely. When the use of symmetry is switched on, VASP determines the point group symmetry and the space group consistent with the structure and initial velocities found on the POSCAR file (this is written out to the OUTCAR file for each NWRITE option), and the initial magnetic moments specified through the MAGMOM tag in the INCAR file. The SYMPREC -tag (VASP.4.4.4 and newer versions) determines by how much atomic positions may differ and still be judged to be equivalent by the symmetry detection algorithms. The default is 10 -5 , which is usually sufficiently large even if the POSCAR file has been generated with a single precision program. Increasing the SYMPREC tag means, that the positions in the POSCAR file can be less accurate. During the symmetry analysis, VASP determines the Bravais lattice type of the supercell, the point group symmetry and the space group of the supercell with basis (static and dynamic) - and prints the names of the group (space group: only 'family'), the type of the generating elementary (primitive) cell if the supercell is a non-primitive cell, all 'trivial non-trivial' translations (= trivial translations of the generating elementary cell within the supercell) -- needed for symmetrization of the charge, the symmetry-irreducible set of k-points if automatic k-mesh generation was used and additionally the symmetry-irreducible set of tetrahedra if the tetrahedron method was chosen together with the automatic k-mesh generation and of course also the corresponding weights ('symmetry degeneracy'), and tables marking and connecting symmetry equivalent ions. The symmetry analysis is done in four steps: First the point group symmetry of the lattice (as supplied by the user) is determined. Then tests are performed, on whether the basis breaks the symmetry. Accordingly, these symmetry operations are removed. The initial velocities are checked for symmetry breaking. Finally, it is checked whether MAGMOM breaks the symmetry. Correspondingly the magnetic symmetry group is determined. The program symmetrizes automatically: The total charge density according to the determined space group The forces on the ions according to the determined space group. The stress tensor according to the determined space group Why is symmetrization necessary: Within LDA the symmetry of the supercell and the charge density is always the same. This symmetry is broken because a symmetry-irreducible set of k points is used for the calculation. To restore the correct charge density and the correct forces it is necessary to symmetrize these quantities. It must be stressed that VASP does not determine the symmetry elements of the primitive cell. If the supercell has a lower symmetry than the primitive cell only the lower symmetry of the supercell is used in the calculation. In this case, one should not expect that forces that should be zero according to symmetry will be precisely zero in actual calculations. The symmetry of the primitive cell is in fact broken in several places in VASP: Local potential: k -points: Related tags and articles OUTCAR , IALGO , IBRION , MDALGO , ISIF , NWRITE Examples that use this tag"

For ALGO = Normal , Fast , and VeryFast , VASP performs a diagonalization in the subspace spanned by all orbitals. This is often referred to as the Rayleigh\u2013Ritz method . This step increases the convergence rate and thus is expedient in most cases. Furthermore, the subspace diagonalization sorts the orbital/eigenvalues in ascending order. For the direct optimization algorithms (for instance ALGO = All or Damped ), a subspace diagonalization is usually not performed, but in order to improve the accuracy of the calculated forces, after convergence has been reached one single diagonalization in the subspace spanned by all orbitals is performed. For ALGO = VeryFast and Damped it is possible to switch off the subspace diagonalization by specifying LDIAG = .FALSE. in the INCAR file. Specifically, for ALGO = VeryFast , LDIAG = .FALSE. changes from an exact Rayleigh\u2013Ritz diagonalization to Loewdin perturbation theory. Note, Loewdin perturbation theory strictly conserves the orbital order, i.e. , the n -th orbital will remain stored in the n -th storage slot and only small rotations into that orbital can occur. For ALGO = Damped and All , the final subspace diagonalization is simply skipped if LDIAG = .FALSE. is set. Generally using LDIAG = .FALSE. is only advised, if one wants to maintain a certain orbital order, for instance, when reading the orbitals from an existing WAVECAR file. For the algorithms ALGO = Normal or Fast , by construction it is not possible to switch off subspace diagonalization, as these algorithms require subspace diagonalizations during the iterative refinement of the orbitals. Furthermore, algorithms that minimize the total energy ( ALGO = All ) are often too \"greedy\" and tend to alternate the orbital order in the course of the SCF cycle and energy optimization. In summary, the following combinations are potentially useful: Other combinations using LDIAG = .FALSE. are likely to yield undesirable results.

    "description": "Defines how the Fermi energy is calculated in VASP. It is recommended to use EFERMI = MIDGAP. Fermi energy in semiconductors For semiconducting materials, the Fermi energy is not uniquely defined in the bandgap of the material. Any value that produces the correct number of electrons ( NELECT ) is allowed. By default, VASP places the Fermi energy at a somewhat arbitrary value within the bandgap. The precise value depends on values chosen for the smearing ( ISMEAR and SIGMA ) and the density of states ( EMIN , EMAX , and NEDOS ). Typically, this places the Fermi energy towards the bottom of the bandgap. You can change this behavior by setting EFERMI = MIDGAP (recommended). VASP will then put the Fermi energy in the middle of the gap because this is the most consistent with increasing the smearing SIGMA . This algorithm to determine the Fermi energy was introduced in VASP.6.4. The value of the Fermi energy should not affect the outcome of the calculation. Fermi energy in metals MIDGAP and LEGACY should yield the same value when your system does not have a gap. The Fermi energy is placed precisely at the value so that underneath are enough states to accommodate NELECT electrons. The evaluation of the Fermi energy involves an integral over the 1. BZ. Therefore, the Fermi energy in metals needs to be converged with respect to the KPOINTS mesh and smearing ( ISMEAR , SIGMA ). Fixed Fermi energy Occasionally, you want to compute systems with fixed Fermi energy for a given charge density. To this end, set EFERMI to a numeric value and ICHARG = 11. A possible use case is to set EFERMI to the converged Fermi energy in a band-structure calculation. You may use this to introduce electron doping/depletion to a system. This is, in particular, important for band-structure calculation of metallic systems because for gaped systems the Fermi energy often still ends up at a valid value within the gap despite the inaccurate computation. Hence, to plot a band structure the band energies should be taken from the calculation with fixed charge density based on k -points along a path, but the Fermi energy should be taken from the calculation based on a k mesh (e.g., the scf calculation by which the charge density was obtained or a more precisely converged Fermi energy based on the same fixed charge density). EFERMI can fix the Fermi energy to the proper value during the band-structure calculation. Related tags and articles ISMEAR , SIGMA , EMIN , EMAX , NEDOS"

SOC couples the spin degrees of freedom with the lattice degrees of freedom. We recommend carefully checking the symmetry and convergence of your results when using SOC; see below. LSORBIT only works for PAW potentials and is not supported by ultrasoft pseudopotentials. It is supported as of VASP.4.5. Assumptions and output Switching on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) adds an additional term {\\displaystyle H^{\\alpha\\beta}_{soc}\\propto\\mathbf{\\sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{L}} {\\displaystyle H^{\\alpha\\beta}_{soc}\\propto\\mathbf{\\sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{L}} to the Hamiltonian that couples the Pauli-spin operator {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\sigma}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\sigma}} with the angular momentum operator {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{L}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{L}} .  As a relativistic correction, SOC acts predominantly in the immediate vicinity of the nuclei. Therefore, it is assumed that contributions of {\\displaystyle H_{soc}} {\\displaystyle H_{soc}} outside the PAW spheres are negligible. Hence, VASP calculates the matrix elements of {\\displaystyle H_{soc}} {\\displaystyle H_{soc}} only for the all-electron one-center contributions It is possible to write the partial magnetization by setting LORBIT , i.e., the site- and orbital-resolved expectation value of the Pauli-spin operator {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\sigma}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\sigma}} . And the partial orbital angular momentum by setting LORBMOM , i.e., the site- and orbital-resolved expectation value of the orbital angular momentum operator {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{L}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{L}} . After a successful calculation including SOC, VASP writes the following results to the OUTCAR file: Symmetry and convergence In any spin-polarized ( ISPIN =2) or noncollinear ( LNONCOLLINEAR =T) calculation, even without SOC, the total energy depends on the relative orientation of magnetic moments. For instance, two magnetic sites may couple ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically. On the other hand, the total energy is independent of the orientation of the magnetic moments with respect to the lattice without SOC. For instance, in-plane and out-of-plane moments on a surface would yield the same energy in the absence of SOC. Switching on SOC couples the spin degrees of freedom that live in spinor space and the lattice degrees of freedom that live in real space, see SAXIS . Therefore, the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic moments on a surface would yield different energies, when including SOC. Similarly, the ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically ordered magnetic moments may additionally align with, e.g., the third lattice vector by setting LSORBIT = True. Generally, be extremely diligent when using SOC: The energy differences can be of the order of few {\\displaystyle \\mu} {\\displaystyle \\mu} eV/atom, k-point convergence is tedious and slow, and the required compute time might be huge, even for small cells. Often, the k-point set changes from one to the other spin orientation, thus worsening the transferability of the results. Note that the WAVECAR file cannot be reread properly if the number of k-points changes. Hence, restart the calculation without symmetry from a converged charge density by setting ICHARG =1! Also, consider the setting of LMAXMIX . We recommend setting GGA_COMPAT = False for noncollinear calculations since this improves the numerical precision of GGA calculations.

Hence, for well converged calculations, we strongly recommend to decrease EDIFF to 1E-6.

On the other hand, for large systems with many atoms and/or when using METAGGA functionals, attaining an energy convergence of 1E-8 or even 1E-7 might be difficult.

    "type": "numeric",
    "description": "NELMDL specifies the number of non-self-consistent steps at the beginning. If the orbitals are initialized using a random number generator (the default in VASP), the initial orbitals are usually unreasonable and the iterative matrix diagonalization will require 5-10 steps to obtain reasonable orbitals. The charge density corresponding to the initial orbitals is also, at best, erratic. It is hence advisable to perform a few electronic steps while keeping the initial Hamiltonian fixed. This initial Hamiltonian is usually determined from a superposition of atomic charge densities (see ICHARG ). Such a 'delay' is absolutely necessary if the SCF-convergence is slow and problematic (e.g. for surfaces or metallic clusters, low dimensional system). Without a delay, VASP will most likely not converge, or at least the convergence speed is slowed significantly. NELMDL might be set to a positive or negative value. A negative value means that the delay is only performed in the first ionic step (usually the recommended option). A positive number means that a delay is employed after each ionic movement. This can improve the convergence speed in VASP.6 (see below) but is not recommended in VASP.5. For calculations using a direct minimization of the Hamiltonian ( ALGO =ALL or ALGO =DAMPED), the Davidson algorithm is used during the delay phase and the Hamiltonian is kept fixed during these steps. Special considerations for VASP.6: For calculations using a direct minimization of the Hamiltonian ( ALGO =ALL or ALGO =DAMPED): if NELMDL is set, the Davidson algorithm is used in the first NELMDL steps as described above. Using a positive NELMDL (i.e. delay in every ionic step) does not work reliably in VASP.5, due to issues in the orbital and charge density prediction. In VASP.6, using NELMDL =1 (or NELMDL =2) and direct minimization often improves the stability and efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations or relaxations ( ALGO =ALL or ALGO =DAMPED). Note, however, that this might require one to prepare a reasonable WAVECAR file since NELMDL =1/2 might not suffice to obtain a reasonable set of orbitals from the initial random numbers. For HF-type calculations, if NELMDL is larger or equal to 3, VASP will perform NELMDL non-selfconsistent steps using the Davidson algorithm, and a local Hamiltonian is calculated using the semi-local DFT functional corresponding to the chosen hybrid functional (i.e. PBE for HSE and PBE0). This is expedient if the ions move by a large distance between the ionic steps. Setting NELMDL =3 can thus improve the stability and performance during relaxations using HF-type Hamiltonians. Try to use ALGO =All and NELMDL =3 if you encounter convergence issues during relaxations using HF-type Hamiltonians. Related tags and articles NELM , NELMIN , IALGO Examples that use this tag"

The weight \u03bb, with which the penalty terms enter into the total energy expression and the Hamiltonian in the above is specified through the LAMBDA tag. As is probably clear from the above, applying constraints by means of a penalty functional contributes to the total energy. This contribution, however, decreases with increasing LAMBDA and can in principle be made vanishingly small  . Increasing LAMBDA stepwise, from one run to another (slowly so the solution remains stable) one thus converges towards the DFT total energy for a given magnetic configuration. When one uses the constrained moment approach, additional information pertaining to the effect of the constraints is written into the OSZICAR file: E_p is the contribution to the total energy arising from the penalty functional. Under M_int VASP lists the integrated magnetic moment at each atomic site. The column labeled MW_int shows the result of the integration of magnetization density which has been smoothed towards the boundary of the sphere. It is actually the smoothed integrated moment which enters in the penalty terms (the smoothing ensures that the total local potential remains continuous at the sphere boundary). One should look at the latter numbers to check whether enough of the magnetization density around each atomic site is contained within the integration sphere and increase RWIGS accordingly. What exactly constitutes \"enough\" in this context is hard to say. It is best to set RWIGS in such a manner that the integration spheres do not overlap and are otherwise as large as possible. Under lambda*MW_perp the constraining \"magnetic field\" at each atomic site is listed. It shows which magnetic field is added to the DFT Hamiltonian to stabilize the magnetic configuration.

In addition, the following keywords must be specified in order to generate the mesh of k-points: IGPAR tag specifies the socalled parallel or {\\displaystyle \\bold{G}_{\\parallel}} {\\displaystyle \\bold{G}_{\\parallel}} direction in the integration over the reciprocal space unit cell. NPPSTR specifies the number of k-points on the strings {\\displaystyle \\bold{k}_{j} = \\bold{k}_{\\perp} + j\\bold{G}_{\\parallel}/\\mathrm{NPPSTR} } {\\displaystyle \\bold{k}_{j} = \\bold{k}_{\\perp} + j\\bold{G}_{\\parallel}/\\mathrm{NPPSTR} } (with {\\displaystyle j=0,..,\\mathrm{NPPSTR}-1} {\\displaystyle j=0,..,\\mathrm{NPPSTR}-1} ). DIPOL specifies the origin with respect to which the ionic contribution to the dipole moment in the cell is calculated. When comparing changes in this contribution due to the displacement of an ion, this center should be chosen in such a way that the ions in the distorted and the undistorted structure remain on the same side of DIPOL (in terms of a minimum image convention). An example: The fluorine displacement dipole (Born effective charge) in NaF First one needs to determine the electronic polarization of the undistorted NaF. Caluclation1: It is usually convenient to calculate the self-consistent Kohn-Sham potential of the undistorted structure, using a symmetry reduced {\\displaystyle 6\\times6\\times6} {\\displaystyle 6\\times6\\times6} Monkhorst-Pack sampling of the Brillouin zone. Using for instance the following INCAR file: KPOINTS file: POSCAR file: and LDA Na_sv and F PAW datasets. Calculation 2: To calculate the electronic contribution to the polarization, along the reciprocal lattice vector {\\displaystyle \\bold{G}_{1}} {\\displaystyle \\bold{G}_{1}} (i.e. {\\displaystyle \\bold{P} \\cdot \\bold{G}_{1} } {\\displaystyle \\bold{P} \\cdot \\bold{G}_{1} } ), add the following lines to the INCAR file: Setting LBERRY = .TRUE. automatically sets ICHARG =11, i.e., the charge density of the previous calculation is read and kept fixed, and only the orbitals and one-electron eigenenergies are recalculated for the new k-point set. This is advantageous, since the number of k-points used to evaluate the Berry phase expression can be quite large, and precalculating the charge density ( ICHARG =11) saves significant CPU time. The OUTCAR will now contain the following lines: Calculations 3 and 4: The procedure mentioned under Calculation 2 now has to be repeated with IGPAR =2 and IGPAR =3 (again using the charge density obtained from Calculation 1), to obtain the contributions to the electronic polarization along {\\displaystyle \\bold{G}_2} {\\displaystyle \\bold{G}_2} and {\\displaystyle \\bold{G}_{3}} {\\displaystyle \\bold{G}_{3}} , respectively. Calculations 5 to 8: To calculate the change in the electronic polarization of NaF due to the displacement of the fluorine sublattice, one should repeat Calculations 1 to 4, using the following POSCAR file: This corresponds to a displacement of the F ion by {\\displaystyle 0.01\\times 4.51\\AA} {\\displaystyle 0.01\\times 4.51\\AA} along the {\\displaystyle \\hat{z}} {\\displaystyle \\hat{z}} direction. The output of the Berry phase calculation using IGPAR =1 should now look similar to: Collecting the results: The change in the electronic contribution to the polarization due to the F-sublattice displacement should be calculated as follows: Take the average of the {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_\\mathrm{ev}} {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_\\mathrm{ev}} terms obtained in calculations 2 to 4. Lets call this {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{ev,undist}}} {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{ev,undist}}} Add the {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{bp}} } {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{bp}} } terms obtained in calculations 2 to 4. Lets call this {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{bp,undist}}} {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{bp,undist}}} The electronic polarization of the undistorted structure is then given by: {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{el,undist}}=e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{ev,undist}}+e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{bp,undist}} } {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{el,undist}}=e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{ev,undist}}+e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{bp,undist}} } Repeat the above three steps for the results obtained using the distorted structure (Calculations 6 to 8), to evaluate {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{ev,dist}}} {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{ev,dist}}} , {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{bp,dist}}} {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{bp,dist}}} , and {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{el,dist}}} {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{el,dist}}} The change in the electronic contribution to the polarization due to the F-sublattice displacement, {\\displaystyle e\\Delta<\\mathrm{r}>_\\mathrm{el}} {\\displaystyle e\\Delta<\\mathrm{r}>_\\mathrm{el}} is then given by {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{el,dist}}-e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{el,undist}}} {\\displaystyle e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{el,dist}}-e<\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{el,undist}}} To calculate the total change in polarization, {\\displaystyle e\\Delta<\\mathrm{r}> } {\\displaystyle e\\Delta<\\mathrm{r}> } , one should account for the ionic contribution to this change. This contribution can be calculated from p as given above from Calculations 2 and 5: {\\displaystyle \\Delta\\mathrm{p}=\\mathrm{p}_{\\mathrm{dist}}-\\mathrm{p}_{\\mathrm{undist}} } {\\displaystyle \\Delta\\mathrm{p}=\\mathrm{p}_{\\mathrm{dist}}-\\mathrm{p}_{\\mathrm{undist}} } . {\\displaystyle e\\Delta<\\mathrm{r}> } {\\displaystyle e\\Delta<\\mathrm{r}> } is then given by {\\displaystyle \\Delta \\mathrm{p}+e\\Delta<\\mathrm{r}>_\\mathrm{el} } {\\displaystyle \\Delta \\mathrm{p}+e\\Delta<\\mathrm{r}>_\\mathrm{el} } . In this example we find {\\displaystyle e\\Delta<\\mathrm{r}>=0.04489} {\\displaystyle e\\Delta<\\mathrm{r}>=0.04489} electrons {\\displaystyle \\AA} {\\displaystyle \\AA} . Considering that the moved F-sublattice was displaced by 0.045102 {\\displaystyle \\AA } {\\displaystyle \\AA } , this calculation yields a Born effective charge for fluorine in NaF of {\\displaystyle Z^{*}=-0.995 } {\\displaystyle Z^{*}=-0.995 } . N.B.(I) In the case of spinpolarized calculations ( ISPIN =2),the Berry phase of the orbitals is evaluated separately for each spin direction. This means a grep on \" {\\displaystyle <\\mathrm{r}> } {\\displaystyle <\\mathrm{r}> } \" will yield two sets of {\\displaystyle <\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{ev}} } {\\displaystyle <\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{ev}} } and {\\displaystyle <\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{bp}}} {\\displaystyle <\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{bp}}} terms, which have to be added to oneanother to obtain the total electronic polarization of the system. N.B.(II) One should take care of the fact that the calculated \"Berry phase\" term {\\displaystyle <\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{bp}}} {\\displaystyle <\\mathrm{r}>_{\\mathrm{bp}}} along {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G}_{i}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G}_{i}} is, in principle, obtained modulo a certain period, determined by the lattice vector {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{R}_{i} } {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{R}_{i} } ( {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{R}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{G}_{i} = 2 \\pi } {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{R}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{G}_{i} = 2 \\pi } ), the spin multiplicity of the orbitals, the volume of the unit cell, the number of k-point in the \"perpendicular\" grid, and some aspects of the symmetry of the system.

    "description": "LTRIPLET selects a triplet ansatz for Bethe-Salpeter-equations (BSE) calculations. This is synonymous to LHARTREE = .FALSE. For a usual BSE calculation ( LHARTREE =.TRUE.; LTRIPLET = .FALSE.), the excited state corresponds to a singlet if the ground state is not spin-polarized ( ISPIN =1) or anti-ferromagnetic ( ISPIN =2, total magnetic moment 0). This is so because the ansatz for the BSE calculation involves a hole and an electron pair prepared within each spin channel. For instance, an electron with up spin is removed from the ground-state determinant and placed with the same spin into a previously unoccupied orbital. If there are no separate spin channels this ansatz results in a net spin-zero, which corresponds to a singlet state. If LTRIPLET =.TRUE., VASP assumes that an up electron is removed from the ground-state determinant and placed as a down electron into a previously unoccupied orbital (spin flip). This ansatz corresponds to a triplet state as it has a net spin of one. Without spin-orbit coupling ( LSORBIT = .FALSE.), the transition probability from the singlet ground state to the triplet solutions will be exactly zero. These excitations correspond to dark, potentially long-lived triplet excitons. However, VASP calculates the transition probabilities incorrectly, by assuming that a spin-flip excitation has the same transition probabilities as a usual singlet excitation. The reported transition probabilities (\"optical transitions\" in vasprun.xml ) are hence incorrect; they should be all zero. Likewise, the contributions to the dielectric function are zero for triplet excitations, and incorrectly reported in the vasprun.xml file. If a non-magnetic material is calculated using ISPIN =2 for both the groundstate and BSE calculation, and a usual BSE calculation is performed ( LHARTREE =.TRUE.; LTRIPLET = .FALSE.), all singlet transitions as well as one set of the triplet excitations (those with {\\displaystyle m_S=0} {\\displaystyle m_S=0} ) are calculated. All triplet transitions will have zero transition probabilities. If LTRIPLET = .TRUE. is set for the BSE calculation, the other two sets of triplet excitations (those with {\\displaystyle m_S=1} {\\displaystyle m_S=1} and {\\displaystyle m_S=-1} {\\displaystyle m_S=-1} ) are determined. Note that as for ISPIN =1 for ISPIN =2 and LTRIPLET = .FALSE., incorrect non-zero transition probabilities are reported in the vasprun.xml file (they should be all exactly zero, since the underlying pair states fed into the BSE can not be excited by light). To obtain meaningful transition probabilities for the singlet and triplet excitations, include spin-orbit coupling by setting LSORBIT = .TRUE. in the INCAR file throughout the calculation, i.e., for the ground-state and BSE calculation. In this case, the singlet and all three sets of triplet excitations are calculated simultaneously, and proper transition probabilities are assigned to each transition. Small transition probabilities might be observed even for triplet excitations as a result of spin-orbit coupling. LTRIPLET = .TRUE. should not be used for calculations including spin-orbit coupling.

    "description": "This tag selects the descriptor type of the three-body descriptor used in machine learning force fields. This tag selects how the three-body descriptor is calculated and the following options are available: ML_DESC_TYPE = 0 : Standard three-body descriptor. The number of descriptors in the calculations scales quadratically with the number of elements. ML_DESC_TYPE = 1 : Descriptor for which the number of descriptors is linearly scaling with respect to the number of chemical species. Standard descriptor The standard three-body descriptor ( ML_DESC_TYPE =0) without self-interaction corrections for the {\\displaystyle i} {\\displaystyle i} th atom looks like the following {\\displaystyle p_{n\\nu l}^{iJJ'}=\\sqrt{\\frac{8\\pi^{2}}{2l+1}} \\sum\\limits_{m=-l}^{l} c_{nlm}^{iJ} c_{\\nu lm}^{iJ'}. } {\\displaystyle p_{n\\nu l}^{iJJ'}=\\sqrt{\\frac{8\\pi^{2}}{2l+1}} \\sum\\limits_{m=-l}^{l} c_{nlm}^{iJ} c_{\\nu lm}^{iJ'}. } Here {\\displaystyle n} {\\displaystyle n} / {\\displaystyle \\nu} {\\displaystyle \\nu} , {\\displaystyle l} {\\displaystyle l} and {\\displaystyle m} {\\displaystyle m} are radial, angular, and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively. {\\displaystyle J} {\\displaystyle J} and {\\displaystyle J'} {\\displaystyle J'} are indices for the element types. Both indices go over all elements in the structure. So one can see that the number of three-body descriptors grows quadratically with the number of element types. Element reduced descriptor Another type of descriptor ( ML_DESC_TYPE =1) which was proposed in Ref.  applies a reduction of one of the intermediate coefficients {\\displaystyle c_{nlm}} {\\displaystyle c_{nlm}} and is written as {\\displaystyle p_{n\\nu l}^{iJ}=\\sqrt{\\frac{8\\pi^{2}}{2l+1}} \\sum\\limits_{m=-l}^{l} c_{nlm}^{iJ} \\sum\\limits_{J'}c_{\\nu lm}^{iJ'}. } {\\displaystyle p_{n\\nu l}^{iJ}=\\sqrt{\\frac{8\\pi^{2}}{2l+1}} \\sum\\limits_{m=-l}^{l} c_{nlm}^{iJ} \\sum\\limits_{J'}c_{\\nu lm}^{iJ'}. } In contrast to the standard three-body descriptor {\\displaystyle p_{n\\nu l}^{iJ}} {\\displaystyle p_{n\\nu l}^{iJ}} depends only linearly on the number of chemical species, since summing over {\\displaystyle J'} {\\displaystyle J'} for {\\displaystyle c_{\\nu lm}^{iJ'}} {\\displaystyle c_{\\nu lm}^{iJ'}} is equivalent to having element agnostic intermediate coefficients. When using this descriptor everything up to the calculation of the descriptors takes the same time to calculate as for the standard descriptor, but everything that comes after that, such as e.g. kernels and forces, scales linearly with respect to the number of chemical species. Hence the factor that is gained in computational efficiency is less than the number of chemical species but the factor increases with an increasing number of local reference configurations employed in the calculations. The improved computational efficiency comes at the price of decreased accuracy. The accuracy loss is system-dependent and is typically around 5 to 20 percent. Additional sparsification All descriptors can be further combined with descriptor sparsification ( ML_LSPARSDES = .TRUE. ). Generally, the sparsification of descriptors results in a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The fraction of descriptors that is kept is specified by ML_RDES_SPARSDES . We advise the user to adjust this parameter carefully and test it individually for each system. However, we have experienced the following trends for our test cases: For ML_DESC_TYPE =0 a descriptor sparsification of 50 percent ML_RDES_SPARSDES =0.5 leaves the accuracy almost untouched. Since ML_DESC_TYPE =1 contains already much fewer descriptors than ML_DESC_TYPE =0, a 50 percent sparsification for ML_DESC_TYPE =1 results in noticeable accuracy loss (additionally to the 5 to 20 percent by the descriptor itself).

The following options are available for this tag: ML_MODE = train : On-the-fly training Force predictions from the machine learning force field are used to drive the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. However, if the error estimation performed in each time step indicates a high force error an ab initio calculation is performed instead and the collected energy, forces, and stress are used to improve the machine learning force field. There are two possible cases depending on, whether an ML_AB is present in the calculation folder or not: No ML_AB file found: On-the-fly training is starting from scratch. Note that at the beginning of the MD run, when there is no force field available or it is still poorly trained, ab initio calculations will happen frequently. For VASP versions prior to 6.4.0 this corresponds to ML_ISTART = 0 . ML_AB file present: Restart on-the-fly training from existing training database. Before the MD run starts the ML_AB file (a copy of the ML_ABN from a previous training run!) is read and the ab initio data (energies, forces, and stresses) and local reference configurations it contains are used to generate an initial force field. Subsequently, the on-the-fly training MD is started. For VASP versions prior to 6.4.0 this corresponds to ML_ISTART = 1 . Tip: None of the structures in the ML_AB file need to match he POSCAR file for the current MD training run in terms of the simulation box, elements, or number of atoms. However, if the same elements appear the initial force field is used for predictions in the current MD run. The training data contained in the ML_AB file is included in the final machine learning force field, i.e., the ML_FFN file will define a force field applicable to both the structures on the ML_AB file as well as to the current MD simulation. This means that by restarting repeatedly with ML_MODE = train , and copying the ML_ABN file from the previous run to ML_AB (!), it is possible to iteratively extend the applicability of the a machine learning force field, e.g., by exploring different temperature ranges or element compositions. ML_MODE = select : Re-selection of local reference configurations A new machine learning force field is generated from the ab initio data provided in the ML_AB file. The structures are read and processed one by one as if harvested in an MD simulation. In other words, the same steps are performed as in on-the-fly training but the source of the data are not actual ab initio calculations in an MD run but the series of structures available in the ML_AB file. The list of local reference configurations on the ML_AB file will be ignored. Instead a new collection of local reference configurations is determined and written to the resulting ML_ABN file. Important: This operation mode allows to generate a VASP machine learning force field from pre-computed or external ab initio data sets. In contrast to ML_MODE = refit also the local reference configurations are selected from the entire data set. For example, an ML_AB file created manually by extracting ab initio data (energies, forces, stresses) from OUTCAR files (or even other external sources) can be processed in this mode without prior knowledge of local reference configurations (only a dummy section must be added to the ML_AB file, see its documentation). Similar to on-the-fly training this mode generates ML_FFN files and ML_ABN with local reference configurations. A new iteration through the training structures can lead to a frequent update of the force field. This is quite time-consuming. Hence, for this mode the default value of ML_CDOUB is automatically increased from 2 to 4 which will result in a much less frequent update of the force field. This leads to much more efficient calculations while practically not changing the results. Tip: If calculations for ML_MODE = select are too time-consuming, it is useful to increase ML_MCONF_NEW to values around 10-16. Together with ML_CDOUB = 4 , this often accelerates the calculations by a factor of 2-4. The ML_AB file may contain values for CTIFOR for each training structure. These are the thresholds used to sample that structure from the previous training. The thresholds found on the ML_AB will be re-used unless a threshold is explicitly specified in the INCAR file, by means of the ML_CTIFOR tag. In the latter case the thresholds from the ML_AB file are ignored. In case the ML_AB contains no CTIFOR information and no threshold is specified in the INCAR file, the default value for ML_CTIFOR is used. This mode automatically sets NSW = 1 and ML_CDOUB = 4 .For VASP versions prior to 6.4.0 this corresponds to ML_ISTART = 3 . Warning: ML_MODE = select ignores the structure in the POSCAR and hence no error, force and stress predictions are made at the end of this calculation (instead zeros are written to stdout, OSZICAR and OUTCAR ). ML_MODE = refit : Refit a force field for \"fast\" evaluation Similar to ML_MODE = select , refitting is done based on an existing ML_AB file, but the number of local reference configurations for each species is taken from the ML_AB file. Sparsification is performed on the local reference configurations, so the resulting ML_ABN file will contain the same number or fewer local reference configurations than the ML_AB file. By default the resulting force field is geared towards \"fast\" evaluation to speed up production runs ( ML_LFAST = .TRUE. ). This comes at the cost of not being able to evaluate Bayesian error estimates. Warning: We strongly advise to use ML_MODE = refit if no Bayesian error estimates are required during production runs. This mode automatically sets ML_LFAST = .TRUE. , NSW = 1 , ML_IALGO_LINREG = 4 , ML_SIGW0 = 1E-7 , ML_SIGV0 = 1 and ML_EPS_LOW = 1E-11 . For VASP versions prior to 6.4.0 this corresponds to ML_ISTART = 4 . ML_MODE = refitbayesian : Refit a force field with Bayesian regression (deprecated) Same as ML_MODE = refit , but Bayesian regression is employed. This results in lower accuracy and much slower force fields than using ML_MODE = refit and should be used with caution. On the other hand, this mode allows the generation of ML_FFN files that can calculate Bayesian error estimates in addition to predictions. This modes sets NSW = 1 , ML_IALGO_LINREG = 1 and ML_LFAST = .FALSE. . For VASP versions prior to 6.4.0 this corresponds to ML_ISTART = 4 . ML_MODE = run : Perform only force field predictions A previously trained machine learning force field is read from the ML_FF file, and the MD simulation is driven with predictions from the force field only. No ab initio calculations are performed and no learning is executed. This setting is typically used when the machine learning force field is considered mature and ready for production runs. Optionally, if the force field was refitted using ML_MODE = refitbayesian , the Bayesian error estimate of the energies, forces, and stress can be computed and logged in the ML_LOGFILE . The output frequency of the Bayesian errors can be set via the ML_IERR tag, the default is 0. For VASP versions prior to 6.4.0 this corresponds to ML_ISTART = 2 .

VASP currently offers parallelization and data distribution over bands and/or over plane wave coefficients, and as of VASP.5.3.2, parallelization over k -points (no data distribution, see KPAR ). To obtain high efficiency on massively parallel systems or modern multi-core machines, it is strongly recommended to use all at the same time. Most algorithms work with any data distribution (except for the single band conjugated gradient, which is considered to be obsolete). NPAR determines how many bands are treated in parallel. The current default is NPAR = number of cores , meaning that one orbital is treated by one core. NCORE is then set to 1. If NPAR =1, NCORE is set to the number of cores. This implies data distribution over plane wave coefficients only: all cores will work together on every individual band, i.e., the plane wave coefficients of each band are distributed over all cores. This is usually very slow and should be avoided. NPAR = number of cores is the optimal setting for platforms with a small communication bandwidth and is a good choice for up to 8 cores, as well as for machines with a single core per node and a Gigabit network. However, this mode substantially increases the memory requirements, because the non-local projector functions must be stored entirely on each core. In addition, substantial all-to-all communications are required to orthogonalize the bands. On massively parallel systems and modern multi-core machines we strongly urge to set or In selected cases, we found that this improves the performance by a factor of up to four compared to the default, and it also significantly improves the stability of the code due to reduced memory requirements. NCORE is available from VASP.5.2.13 on, and is more handy than the previous parameter NPAR . The user should either specify NCORE or NPAR , where NPAR takes a higher preference. The relation between both parameters is The optimum settings for NPAR and LPLANE depend strongly on the type of machine you are using.

We furthermore recommend to increase NOMEGA not beyond 100 for a {\\displaystyle k} {\\displaystyle k} -point sampling of 4x4x4 points/atom: the joint DOS and the self-energy tend to possess spurious fine structure related to the finite {\\displaystyle k} {\\displaystyle k} -point grid.

If at any point during iterating the above equations, the quadratic norm of errors (eight column of REGR/REGRF in ML_LOGFILE ) becomes too large (more than 1.2 times larger than in previous iterations), the code assumes that numerical issues (loss of significance) have occurred, and then ML_EPS_REG is automatically doubled. Furthermore, if the regression does not converge within 10 steps, ML_EPS_REG is also increased by a factor of 4. The maximum allowed iteration depths is 50 (the iteration number is the second entry of REGR/REGRF in ML_LOGFILE ). When 50 iterations are reached, no force field is created and there is most likely something seriously wrong in the calculation. The seventh entry of REGR/REGRF in the ML_LOGFILE shows the ratio of the regularization ( {\\displaystyle \\sigma_{v}^{2}/ \\sigma_{w}^{2}} {\\displaystyle \\sigma_{v}^{2}/ \\sigma_{w}^{2}} ) and the largest eigenvalue. Usually this number is a number with many varying digits. If this number becomes a \"well rounded\" number (e.g. 1.00000000E-14), this is an indication that the cap for the current ML_EPS_REG is reached. That means that regularization becomes crucial.

This tag is usually switched on by ML_MODE = refit and doesn't need to be set explicitely. This tag switches on the descriptors for the fast execution mode. To use the fast execution mode the force field first has to be refit with the fast descriptors. This is done by setting ML_MODE = refit , which will automatically set ML_LFAST . As usual, the resulting ML_FFN has to be copied to ML_FF and the fast code will be automatically run in production mode runs by setting ML_MODE . The speedup of the fast method compared to the regular method is increasing with increasing number of local reference configurations. It should be noted that in the fast version no Bayesian error estimation is available.

LDAUTYPE =4: Same as LDAUTYPE =1, but without exchange splitting. A method to estimate the parameters for DFT+U is the constrained-random-phase approximation . Another method is the linear response ansatz with LDAUTYPE =3, mentioned above. On the other hand, in many applications, the DFT+U parameters are used as tuning parameters to fit experimental data. This is because the CHGCAR file contains only information up to angular momentum quantum number set by LMAXMIX for the on-site PAW occupancy matrices . When the CHGCAR file is read and kept fixed in the course of the calculations ( ICHARG =11), the results will necessarily not be identical to a self-consistent run. The deviations are often large for DFT+U calculations. It is possible to use LDAUTYPE =1, 2, and 3 for a non\u2013spin-polarized calculation with ISPIN =1.

    "description": "LCALCPOL =.TRUE. switches on the evaluation of the Berry phase expressions for the macroscopic electronic polarization in accordance with the so-called Modern Theory of Polarization . For LCALCPOL =.TRUE., VASP calculates the electronic contribution to the polarization, along the three reciprocal lattice vectors G i , i=1,2,3, (i.e. \u03a3 i P \u00b7 G i ) in a single run (unlike LBERRY =.TRUE.). An example: The fluorine displacement dipole (Born effective charge) in NaF With INCAR file: KPOINTS file: POSCAR file: and LDA Na_sv and F PAW datasets. The OUTCAR file should now contain the following lines: Here the units \"electrons Angst\" denote {\\displaystyle e\\AA=-1.602 10^{-19}C\\AA} {\\displaystyle e\\AA=-1.602 10^{-19}C\\AA} . To calculate the change in the electronic polarization of NaF due to the displacement of the fluorine sublattice we repeat the previous calculation with the following POSCAR file: The OUTCAR should now contain something very similar to the following lines: From the above one easily recognizes that the change in the electronic dipole moment due to the F-sublattice displacement is: {\\displaystyle \\Delta\\mathrm{p}=0.3606\\hat{z}\\;e\\AA} {\\displaystyle \\Delta\\mathrm{p}=0.3606\\hat{z}\\;e\\AA} and the corresponding change in the ionic dipole moment: {\\displaystyle \\Delta\\mathrm{p}=1.93939-2.25510=-0.31571\\hat{z}\\;e\\AA} {\\displaystyle \\Delta\\mathrm{p}=1.93939-2.25510=-0.31571\\hat{z}\\;e\\AA} Thus the total change is found to be: {\\displaystyle \\Delta\\mathrm{p}=0.36061-0.31571=0.0449\\hat{z}\\;e\\AA} {\\displaystyle \\Delta\\mathrm{p}=0.36061-0.31571=0.0449\\hat{z}\\;e\\AA} and considering that the F-sublattice was displaced by 0.045102 Angstrom these calculations yield a Born effective charge for fluorine of {\\displaystyle Z^*=0.0449/0.045102=-0.995|e|\\;} {\\displaystyle Z^*=0.0449/0.045102=-0.995|e|\\;} .

  "NMAXFOCKAE_and_LMAXFOCKAE": {

    "type": "numeric",
    "description": "NMAXFOCKAE and LMAXFOCKAE determine whether the overlap densities in the Fock exchange and correlated wave function methods are accurately reconstructed on the plane wave grid (shape restoration). This flag generally only applies to the Fock-exchange part as well as many-body post DFT methods (GW, RPA, MP2, etc.). Detailed Discussion In the PAW method, the difference between the charge density of the all-electron partial waves {\\displaystyle \\phi_\\beta} {\\displaystyle \\phi_\\beta} and the pseudo partial waves {\\displaystyle \\tilde \\phi_\\beta} {\\displaystyle \\tilde \\phi_\\beta} {\\displaystyle Q_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\mathbf r})= \\phi^*_\\alpha({\\mathbf r})\\phi_\\beta({\\mathbf r}) - \\tilde \\phi^*_\\alpha({\\mathbf r})\\tilde \\phi_\\beta({\\mathbf r}) } {\\displaystyle Q_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\mathbf r})= \\phi^*_\\alpha({\\mathbf r})\\phi_\\beta({\\mathbf r}) - \\tilde \\phi^*_\\alpha({\\mathbf r})\\tilde \\phi_\\beta({\\mathbf r}) } is usually treated on spherical grids centered at each atom (one-center terms inside the PAW spheres, see PAW method and more detailed description for LMAXFOCK ). To describe long range electrostatic effects, the moments of the differences of the all-electron and pseudo charge density also need to be added on the plane wave grid (compensation density, see PAW method ). These compensation charges exactly restore the moments of the all-electron density on the plane wave grid. For the Fock exchange the maximum L quantum number up to which the augmentation is done is controlled by LMAXFOCK . For the RPA, GW, and most post DFT methods, the one-center terms are, however, presently not implemented. Depending on the material, this can cause sizable errors in particular for 3d and (to a lesser extent) 2p, 4d and 5d elements. To correct for this error, an alternative treatment is implemented on the plane wave grid for the exchange and correlation contributions. This allows to restore the all-electron densities accurately already on the plane wave grid by specifying the flags LMAXFOCKAE and NMAXFOCKAE . This improved treatment\u2014 termed shape restoration \u2014is available for exchange as well as many body correlation contributions. For exchange, the exact one-center terms are also implemented. This means shape restoration is not required and should not change the results. To achieve the improved treatment on the plane wave grid, {\\displaystyle Q_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\mathbf r}) } {\\displaystyle Q_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\mathbf r}) } is Fourier transformed to reciprocal space {\\displaystyle Q_{\\alpha\\beta}(q) } {\\displaystyle Q_{\\alpha\\beta}(q) } and then expanded in a set of orthogonal functions localized at each atomic site. These augmentation charges are then added to the pseudo charge densities on the plane wave grid. Shape restoration is only accurate up to a certain plane wave cutoff, typically about 150 eV for NMAXFOCKAE =1, and 400 eV for NMAXFOCKAE = 2. Experience shows that NMAXFOCKAE =1 is sufficient to predict very accurate energy differences and quite accurate quasiparticle energies. For LMAXFOCKAE =-1 (the default for DFT and Hartree-Fock calculations), only the moments of the all-electron charge densities are restored on the plane wave grid. This is the default for Hartree-Fock calculations, and the setting is very precise since for Hartree-Fock the one-center terms are implemented in radial grids as for DFT. If LMAXFOCKAE is set to values larger than -1 (and NMAXFOCKAE =1), not only the moments of the all-electron charge density are restored on the plane wave grid, but also the all-electron charge density is restored up to a typical plane wave energy of 150 eV (controlled by QMAXFOCKAE ). This setting yields very accurate results for post DFT methods (MP2, RPA, GW, etc.) for most sp bonded materials. LMAXFOCKAE is used to specify the maximum spherical ( L ) quantum number up to which this more accurate treatment is used. The default is LMAXFOCKAE =4 for post DFT methods. If no accurate augmentation is desired by the user, simply set LMAXFOCKAE =-1 in the INCAR file. If LMAXFOCKAE is set to values larger than -1 and NMAXFOCKAE =2, the charge density is restored accurately on the plane wave grid up to a typical plane wave energy of 400 eV. As before, LMAXFOCKAE can be used to specify the maximum spherical ( L ) quantum number up to which this more accurate treatment is used. NMAXFOCKAE =2 yields very accurate results for post DFT methods (MP2, RPA, GW) even for difficult 3d elements. For RPA and MP2 total energy calculations, differences between NMAXFOCKAE =1 and NMAXFOCKAE =2 are usually tiny for total energy differences. Since the absolute correlation energies might change, it is, however, vital to use the same setting for NMAXFOCKAE and LMAXFOCKAE , if energy differences are calculated. For GW calculations, increasing NMAXFOCKAE from 1 to 2 might change QP energies by 100-200 meV for 3d and late 4d and 5d elements. Despite the improve precision, NMAXFOCKAE =2 should be used with great caution. Specifically, noise and egg-box effects are introduced as NMAXFOCKAE is increased. So use this flag only after extensive tests. The setting for LMAXFOCKAE should be also considered carefully. Generally, it suffices to set LMAXFOCKAE to twice the maximum l quantum number found in the POTCAR file. For instance for sp elements, LMAXFOCKAE = 2 suffices. For d elements, LMAXFOCKAE = 4 suffices (a d electron can create charge densities with L -quantum numbers up to 4), whereas for f elements, users should test whether LMAXFOCKAE = 6 is required. More details on shape restoration are explained in Ref.  and  . Usefull Settings In summary, useful manual settings of NMAXFOCKAE and LMAXFOCKAE are: LMAXFOCKAE =-1, to switch off the accurate augmentation altogether (reduces noise in correlation energies). LMAXFOCKAE =4 (or larger) to force an accurate treatment for the charge augmentation on the plane wave grid (can be selected even in Hartree-Fock type calculations, but causes some additional noise). NMAXFOCKAE =2, to select the very accurate augmentation on the plane wave grid. Please check whether the VASP default setting for LMAXFOCKAE suffices (OUTCAR file). Use this setting only with care, as it can result in very noisy data for coarse FFT grids. Related tags and articles LMAXFOCK , QMAXFOCKAE , LFOCKAEDFT Examples that use this tag"

The presence of a dipole in combination with periodic boundary conditions leads to a slow convergence of the total energy with the size of the supercell. Furthermore, finite-size errors affect the potential and the forces. This effect can be counterbalanced by setting LDIPOL =.TRUE. in the INCAR file. For LDIPOL =.TRUE., a linear correction, and for charged cells, a quadratic electrostatic potential is added to the local potential in order to correct the errors introduced by the periodic boundary conditions. When activating this tag the tag IDIPOL has to be specified, and optionally the tag DIPOL as well. The biggest advantage of this mode is that leading errors in the forces are corrected and that the work function can be evaluated for asymmetric slabs. The disadvantage is that the convergence to the electronic ground state might slow down considerably, i.e., more electronic iterations might be required to obtain the required precision.

This allows to restore the all-electron densities accurately already on the plane wave grid by specifying the flags LMAXFOCKAE and NMAXFOCKAE . This improved treatment\u2014 termed shape restoration \u2014is available for exchange as well as many body correlation contributions. For exchange, the exact one-center terms are also implemented. This means shape restoration is not required and should not change the results. To achieve the improved treatment on the plane wave grid, {\\displaystyle Q_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\mathbf r}) } {\\displaystyle Q_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\mathbf r}) } is Fourier transformed to reciprocal space {\\displaystyle Q_{\\alpha\\beta}(q) } {\\displaystyle Q_{\\alpha\\beta}(q) } and then expanded in a set of orthogonal functions localized at each atomic site. These augmentation charges are then added to the pseudo charge densities on the plane wave grid. Shape restoration is only accurate up to a certain plane wave cutoff, typically about 150 eV for NMAXFOCKAE =1, and 400 eV for NMAXFOCKAE = 2. Experience shows that NMAXFOCKAE =1 is sufficient to predict very accurate energy differences and quite accurate quasiparticle energies. For LMAXFOCKAE =-1 (the default for DFT and Hartree-Fock calculations), only the moments of the all-electron charge densities are restored on the plane wave grid. This is the default for Hartree-Fock calculations, and the setting is very precise since for Hartree-Fock the one-center terms are implemented in radial grids as for DFT. If LMAXFOCKAE is set to values larger than -1 (and NMAXFOCKAE =1), not only the moments of the all-electron charge density are restored on the plane wave grid, but also the all-electron charge density is restored up to a typical plane wave energy of 150 eV (controlled by QMAXFOCKAE ). This setting yields very accurate results for post DFT methods (MP2, RPA, GW, etc.) for most sp bonded materials. LMAXFOCKAE is used to specify the maximum spherical ( L ) quantum number up to which this more accurate treatment is used. The default is LMAXFOCKAE =4 for post DFT methods. If no accurate augmentation is desired by the user, simply set LMAXFOCKAE =-1 in the INCAR file. If LMAXFOCKAE is set to values larger than -1 and NMAXFOCKAE =2, the charge density is restored accurately on the plane wave grid up to a typical plane wave energy of 400 eV. As before, LMAXFOCKAE can be used to specify the maximum spherical ( L ) quantum number up to which this more accurate treatment is used. NMAXFOCKAE =2 yields very accurate results for post DFT methods (MP2, RPA, GW) even for difficult 3d elements. For RPA and MP2 total energy calculations, differences between NMAXFOCKAE =1 and NMAXFOCKAE =2 are usually tiny for total energy differences. Since the absolute correlation energies might change, it is, however, vital to use the same setting for NMAXFOCKAE and LMAXFOCKAE , if energy differences are calculated. For GW calculations, increasing NMAXFOCKAE from 1 to 2 might change QP energies by 100-200 meV for 3d and late 4d and 5d elements. Despite the improve precision, NMAXFOCKAE =2 should be used with great caution. Specifically, noise and egg-box effects are introduced as NMAXFOCKAE is increased. So use this flag only after extensive tests. The setting for LMAXFOCKAE should be also considered carefully. Generally, it suffices to set LMAXFOCKAE to twice the maximum l quantum number found in the POTCAR file. For instance for sp elements, LMAXFOCKAE = 2 suffices. For d elements, LMAXFOCKAE = 4 suffices (a d electron can create charge densities with L -quantum numbers up to 4), whereas for f elements, users should test whether LMAXFOCKAE = 6 is required. More details on shape restoration are explained in Ref.  and  . Usefull Settings In summary, useful manual settings of NMAXFOCKAE and LMAXFOCKAE are: LMAXFOCKAE =-1, to switch off the accurate augmentation altogether (reduces noise in correlation energies). LMAXFOCKAE =4 (or larger) to force an accurate treatment for the charge augmentation on the plane wave grid (can be selected even in Hartree-Fock type calculations, but causes some additional noise). NMAXFOCKAE =2, to select the very accurate augmentation on the plane wave grid. Please check whether the VASP default setting for LMAXFOCKAE suffices (OUTCAR file). Use this setting only with care, as it can result in very noisy data for coarse FFT grids. Related tags and articles LMAXFOCK , QMAXFOCKAE , LFOCKAEDFT Examples that use this tag"

This can be done with XC =TASK_X PW92_C in INCAR . (3) A few points about the MBJ and LMBJ potentials: POTCAR files: required information Calculations with a meta-GGA that depends on the kinetic-energy density require POTCAR files that include information on the kinetic-energy density of the core electrons. Almost all recent POTCAR files do fulfill this requirement, but there are some notable exceptions like O_GW. To check whether a particular POTCAR contains this information, type: This should yield at least the following lines (for each element on the file): and for PAW datasets with partial core corrections: Aspherical contributions related to one-center terms LASPH =.TRUE. should be selected if a meta-GGA functional is selected. If LASPH =.FALSE., the one-center contributions are only calculated for a spherically averaged density and kinetic-energy density. This means that the one-center contributions to the Kohn-Sham potential are also spherical. Since the PAW method describes the entire space using plane waves, errors are often small even if the non-spherical contributions to the Kohn-Sham potential are neglected inside the PAW spheres (additive augmentation, as opposed to the APW or FLAPW method where the plane wave contribution only describes the interstitial region between the atoms). Anyhow, if the density is strongly non-spherical around some atoms in your structure, LASPH =.TRUE. must be selected. Non-spherical terms are particularly encountered in d- and f-elements, dimers, molecules, and solids with strong directional bonds. Convergence issues If convergence problems are encountered, it is recommended to preconverge the calculations using the PBE functional and start the calculation from the WAVECAR file corresponding to the PBE ground state. Furthermore, ALGO = A (conjugate gradient algorithm for orbitals) is often more stable than charge density mixing, in particular if the system contains vacuum regions.

The label indicates if this is an exchange (X), correlation (C), or exchange-correlation (XC) functional, and which family it belongs to, namely LDA (LDA or HYB_LDA), GGA (GGA or HYB_GGA) or meta-GGA (MGGA or HYB_MGGA).

Note that if one of the tags ( LIBXC1 or LIBXC2 ) corresponds to a meta-GGA, while the other corresponds to a GGA or LDA, then METAGGA = LIBXC (and not GGA = LIBXC) has to be specified.

The three integers of RANDOM_SEED must fulfill these conditions: A typical input for the RANDOM_SEED looks like this: The initial value of RANDOM_SEED and the value after each MD step are written to the REPORT file.

    "description": "LMAXFOCK sets the maximum angular momentum quantum number L for the augmentation of charge densities in Hartree-Fock type routines. In the PAW method , the difference between the charge density of the all-electron partial waves {\\displaystyle \\phi_\\beta} {\\displaystyle \\phi_\\beta} and the pseudo partial waves {\\displaystyle \\tilde \\phi_\\beta} {\\displaystyle \\tilde \\phi_\\beta} {\\displaystyle Q_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\mathbf r})= \\phi^*_\\alpha({\\mathbf r})\\phi_\\beta({\\mathbf r}) - \\tilde \\phi^*_\\alpha({\\mathbf r})\\tilde \\phi_\\beta({\\mathbf r}) } {\\displaystyle Q_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\mathbf r})= \\phi^*_\\alpha({\\mathbf r})\\phi_\\beta({\\mathbf r}) - \\tilde \\phi^*_\\alpha({\\mathbf r})\\tilde \\phi_\\beta({\\mathbf r}) } is usually treated on spherical grids centered at each atom (one-center terms inside the PAW spheres, see PAW method ). To describe long range electrostatic effects, the moments of the differences of the all-electron and pseudo charge density also need to be added on the plane wave grid (compensation density, see PAW method ). These compensation charges exactly restore the moments of the all-electron density on the plane wave grid. For the charge densities used in the Hartree and DFT term, the augmentation is done exactly up to the maximum L quantum number required by the POTCAR files, whereas for the Fock exchange, for reasons of efficiency, the augmentation on the plane wave grid is controlled by LMAXFOCK . Specifically, when the exchange energy is evaluated the overlap density {\\displaystyle \\psi_{n\\mathbf{k}}^{*}(\\mathbf{r})\\psi_{m\\mathbf{q}}(\\mathbf{r}) } {\\displaystyle \\psi_{n\\mathbf{k}}^{*}(\\mathbf{r})\\psi_{m\\mathbf{q}}(\\mathbf{r}) } between two Bloch orbitals needs to be calculated on the plane wave grid (see PAW method ). The tag LMAXFOCK controls up to which L quantum number, the compensation charge {\\displaystyle \\widehat{n}(\\mathbf{r})} {\\displaystyle \\widehat{n}(\\mathbf{r})} is calculated on the plane wave grid (compared PAW method compensation charge): {\\displaystyle \\widehat{n}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta,LM} \\widehat{Q}_{\\alpha,\\beta}^{LM}(\\mathbf{r})\\, \\langle \\widetilde{\\psi}_{nk} | \\widetilde{p}_{\\alpha} \\rangle \\langle \\widetilde{p}_{\\beta} | \\widetilde{\\psi}_{mk} \\rangle. } {\\displaystyle \\widehat{n}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta,LM} \\widehat{Q}_{\\alpha,\\beta}^{LM}(\\mathbf{r})\\, \\langle \\widetilde{\\psi}_{nk} | \\widetilde{p}_{\\alpha} \\rangle \\langle \\widetilde{p}_{\\beta} | \\widetilde{\\psi}_{mk} \\rangle. } To accelerate convergence with respect to LMAXFOCK , VASP uses a small trick: the contributions from the Hartree-Fock one-center terms are evaluated for the pseudo orbitals also only up to L = LMAXFOCK , whereas the one-center terms for the exact all-electron orbitals are evaluated up to the maximum required L (twice the angular quantum number of the partial wave with the highest l ). The default is LMAXFOCK =4, and it might be necessary to increase this parameter, if the system contains f-electrons. Since this increases the computational load considerably (about factor 2), it is recommended to perform tests, whether the results are already reasonably converged using the default LMAXFOCK =4. To be compatible w.r.t. old releases, VASP also reads the flag HFLMAX to the same effect as LMAXFOCK . Related tags and articles HFLMAX , LMAXFOCKAE Examples that use this tag"

Orthorhombic case For orthorhombic unit cells {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{A}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{A}} is of diagonal form: {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & a_{22} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & a_{33} \\end{bmatrix}, } {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & a_{22} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & a_{33} \\end{bmatrix}, } Therefore by setting one of the entries of LATTICE_CONSTRAINTS to FALSE the lattice parameter in this direction will not be allowed to change. For MD simulations ( IBRION =0), we recommend using LATTICE_CONSTRAINTS for (orthorhombic) liquids in the isobaric-isothermal ( NpT ) ensemble in the following way: Here, the first two lattice constants are not allowed to change. The third lattice constant needs to be free to allow volume changes for the barostat. The system is then like a piston. The constraints are necessary for liquids in NpT simulations because if all lattice degrees of freedom are allowed to relax, irreversible deformations of the cell are very likely to happen. This can lead to undesirable results like a very flat supercell, which cannot be used to obtain valid MD trajectories. For structure relaxation ( IBRION =1,2), LATTICE_CONSTRAINTS is useful to relax the lattice constants of 2D materials. In case of a slab in the {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{a}_1} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{a}_1} - {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{a}_2} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{a}_2} plane, add vacuum padding along {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{a}_3} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{a}_3} and set Non-orthorhombic case For non-orthorhombic boxes LATTICE_CONSTRAINTS is more complicated to use. The tag will set certain rows and columns of the stress tensor {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\sigma} = \\begin{bmatrix} xx & xy & xz \\\\ yx & yy & yz \\\\ zx & zy & zz \\end{bmatrix}, } {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\sigma} = \\begin{bmatrix} xx & xy & xz \\\\ yx & yy & yz \\\\ zx & zy & zz \\end{bmatrix}, } to zero. By setting certain entries of the stress tensor to zero the corresponding entries of the lattice {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{A}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{A}} will not be updated. For example when setting LATTICE_CONSTRAINTS = .FALSE. .TRUE. .TRUE. the used stress tensor will look like {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\sigma} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & yy & yz \\\\ 0 & zy & zz \\end{bmatrix}, } {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\sigma} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & yy & yz \\\\ 0 & zy & zz \\end{bmatrix}, } and therefore the first row and the first column of the lattice {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{A}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{A}} will not change. Another example would be to set LATTICE_CONSTRAINTS = .FALSE. .TRUE. .FALSE. resulting in the following stress tensor {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\sigma} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & yy & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} } {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\sigma} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & yy & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} } So only the {\\displaystyle yy} {\\displaystyle yy} / {\\displaystyle a_{22}} {\\displaystyle a_{22}} entry of the lattice {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{A}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{A}} will change.

ICHIBARE determines the order of the finite difference stencil used to calculate the magnetic susceptibility (second order derivative in Eq. 47 of Yates et al.  ). Note that magnetic susceptibility is a bulk property, while chemical shift is for each nucleus  . A higher ICHIBARE results in a substantial increase of the computational load. For NLSPLINE =.TRUE., the PAW projectors in reciprocal space ( LREAL =.FALSE.) are set up using a spline interpolation so that they are k -differentiable. This improves the susceptibility contribution to the shifts (via the aforementioned Eq. 47). Other contributions to the shifts (Eqs. 38 and 40) are only slightly affected. LNMR_SYM_RED =.TRUE. is recommended. The star on which the k -space derivative is calculated is oriented along the cartesian directions in k -space. If the symmetry operations in k -space do not map this star onto itself, erroneous results can be obtained. LNMR_SYM_RED =.TRUE. checks for such operations, discarding them, resulting in a larger IBZ. There are also some additional tags relevant to LCHIMAG that are not used in the example INCAR that should be considered in special cases: LBONE adds the small B-component to the chemical shift tensor  . LVGVCALC uses the vGv expression when calculating the orbital magnetic susceptibility   . LVGVAPPL uses vGv orbital magnetic susceptibility when calculating the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensor. LLRAUG calculates the two-center contributions to the chemical shielding tensor . The chemical shift is calculated via the induced current (cf. LWRTCUR )   . It has contributions from the plane wave grid and one-center contributions (the induced field at the center of a PAW sphere due to the augmentation current inside that sphere). Two-center contributions (induced fields due to augmentation currents in other PAW spheres) are standard neglected. These contributions can be switched on using LLRAUG . Output The isotropic chemical shieldings are printed towards the end of the OUTCAR file, after the self-consistent calculation has finished. The chemical shift tensors both before and after space group symmetrization. These are the absolute tensors for the infinite lattice, excluding core contributions. They can be searched for under the UNSYMMETRIZED TENSORS and SYMMETRIZED TENSORS after Absolute Chemical Shift tensors . Additionally, the magnetic susceptibility is printed shortly after and found under ORBITAL MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY . To obtain the full absolute tensors requires adding both the {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G=0}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G=0}} contribution and the contributions due to the core electrons. The latter consist of contributions for each chemical species separately (depending on POTCAR ) and a global {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G=0}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G=0}} susceptibility contribution. The reference shift experienced by the core is given first: Finally the tensor is processed and its (CSA) characteristics are printed in the OUTCAR . The tensor is symmetrized ( {\\displaystyle \\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}} {\\displaystyle \\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}} is enforced) and diagonalized. From the three diagonal values the isotropic chemical \"shift\" {\\displaystyle \\delta_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\mathrm{}} {\\displaystyle \\delta_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\mathrm{}} , span {\\displaystyle \\Omega} {\\displaystyle \\Omega} and skew {\\displaystyle \\kappa} {\\displaystyle \\kappa} are calculated and printed see Ref.  for unambiguous definitions. Note that {\\displaystyle \\kappa} {\\displaystyle \\kappa} is ill-defined if {\\displaystyle \\Omega = 0} {\\displaystyle \\Omega = 0} . Units are ppm, except for the skew. A typical output is given below: The isotropic chemical shielding for each atom, excluding and including G=0 contributions, as well as the span and skew (descriptions of asymmetry), follow. Finally, core contributions are taken into account for the ISO_SHIFT , SPAN , and SKEW . By default the orbital magnetic susceptibility is calculated using the so-called pGv -approximation, i.e. Eqs. 46-48 of Yates et al.  . As of vasp.6.4.0 also the vGv -approximation of the susceptibility is calculated. By default, the pGv result is applied for the {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G=0}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G=0}} contribution to the shifts. With LVGVAPPL one can force VASP to use the vGv result for the {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G=0}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G=0}} contribution instead. With LVGVCALC one can suppress calculation of the vGv susceptibility. For details see LVGVCALC . Advice and recommendations Input parameters A larger ENCUT value than usual, generally much higher than the value given by ENMAX in the POTCAR file, e.g. 800 eV for C. A small EDIFF is typically required to provide converged chemical shifts, e.g. 1E-8 eV. Tighter precision, e.g. PREC = Accurate. Two additional terms may make a difference depending on your system, which should be tested with and without to determine their importance: Non-spherical contributions to the gradient of the density inside PAW spheres, i.e. LASPH = .TRUE. Occasionally, e.g. for systems containing H or first-row elements, and short bonds, the two-center contributions are important. In this case, LLRAUG = .TRUE. should be used   . PAW pseudopotentials No special POTCAR files are necessary. The GIPAW is applied using the projectors functions and partial waves that are stored in the regular POTCAR files. A few remarks, however, on accuracy in relation to the different POTCAR flavours: Results sensitively depend on the quality, i.e. , completeness of the partial wave/projector function set in the energy range needed for good chemical transferability. Result obtained with different POTCAR flavours can differ a few ppm for first and second row sp -bonded elements (except for H). Use POTCAR files generated with a consistent exchange-correlation functional. The PAW reconstruction with AE partial waves is crucial as the field on the nucleus needs to be calculated. So avoid, if possible, overriding LEXCH from POTCAR with an explicit GGA -tag in the INCAR . Insufficient memory In the case of insufficient memory, there are a few options. Speed has been favored over saving memory. Since the linear response calculation is parallel over k -points, this can be used to economize on memory: First, do a regular self-consistent calculation at high accuracy for the full k -point mesh. Save the CHGCAR file. Second, do a chemical shift calculation for each k -point in the IBZ separately, starting from CHGCAR , i.e. , using ICHARG =11. Finally, calculate the shifts as a k -point weighted average of the symmetrized shifts of the individual k -points.

To achieve this, two molecular dynamics simulations are performed with e.g. different POTCAR or KPOINTS files or different exchange-correlation functionals, and force averaging between the two calculations is done  . The tag VCAIMAGES internally splits the available nodes into two groups, and each group then performs an independent VASP calculation (this implies VCAIMAGES only works in the MPI version). This behavior is implemented in the same way as the nudged elastic band method described under the tag IMAGES . As opposed to the nudged elastic band method, VASP creates always two images by setting the tag IMAGES =2 internally. The two calculations are performed in subdirectories 01 and 02 (as opposed to the nudged elastic band method, subdirectories 00 and 03 are not required). A precise description of the file reading and writing is given below. The two VASP calculations are essentially performed independently in subdirectories 01 and 02. The forces, energies and the stress tensor of the two calculations are averaged according to the tag VCAIMAGES . Specifically, the value supplied in the tag VCAIMAGES determines the weight of the calculations performed in subdirectory 01. The weight of the second image is 1- VCAIMAGES . The averaging is performed after self-consistency has been reached and affects the final total energy as well as the forces. Since the energies and forces are averaged, the trajectories generated by the two simulations will be exactly identical. Make sure though, that the initial POSCAR files in the two subdirectories are exactly identical. The averaged energies can be found in the OUTCAR file after the lines \"ENERGY OF THE ELECTRON-ION-THERMOSTAT SYSTEM (eV)\", as well as in the file OSZICAR (in the lines writing the free energy \"F=\"). This makes scanning the OSZICAR file for the required energies of the individual calculations somewhat awkward. Special handling: In some cases it might be desirable to use a different number of cores for the first image and the second image. For instance, this might be expedient for calculations where thermodynamic integration is performed from a coarse to a dense k-point grid, or from a cheap to an expensive exchange-correlation functional. To set the number of cores in the first image the tag NCORE_IN_IMAGE1 has to be set. The second image then contains the remaining cores.

    "description": "Initial magnetic moment for each atom if no magnetization density is present. Considered when symmetry is determined. For a magnetic calculation from scratch ( ISTART =0), MAGMOM specifies (i) the initial on-site magnetic moment for each atom, and (ii) lowers the symmetry of the system (as of VASP.4.4.4). A magnetic calculation could be either a spin-polarized calculation ( ISPIN =2) or noncollinear calculation ( LNONCOLLINEAR =T). If the MAGMOM line breaks a symmetry of the crystal, the corresponding symmetry operation is removed and not applied during the symmetrization of, e.g., charges and forces. When restarting a magnetic calculation , MAGMOM is only used to determine the symmetry of the system and not to set the on-site magnetic moment. Therefore, if you remove the MAGMOM tag before restarting from a converged WAVECAR or CHGCAR , the magnetization is likely to be symmetrized away. MAGMOM also specifies the initial on-site magnetic moments when a magnetic calculation ( ISPIN =2 or LNONCOLLINEAR =T) is started from a non-spin-polarized calculation ( ISPIN =1 and LNONCOLLINEAR =F). This implies restarting with ICHARG =1 while the CHGCAR file contains no magnetization density. Starting magnetic calculations from a non-spin-polarized calculation can improve convergence. The I_CONSTRAINED_M tag can constrain the on-site magnetic moments. Format and basis For a spin-polarized calculation ( ISPIN =2), MAGMOM is a list of NIONS positive or negative values that specify the magnitude and relative orientation of the magnetization on each ion. The on-site magnetic moments have no direction in real space, i.e., no orientation in the lattice. For noncollinear calculation ( LNONCOLLINEAR =T), the on-site magnetic moment is specified by three components for each ion. Without spin-orbit coupling ( LSORBIT =False), the total energy depends only on the relative direction of the on-site magnetic moments. Hence, you can give the desired magnetic structure in Cartesian coordinates without considering how the lattice matrix or SAXIS is defined. With spin-orbit coupling ( LSORBIT =True), the three components must be specified in the basis of spinor space that is defined by SAXIS . The default is {\\displaystyle \\sigma_1=\\hat x} {\\displaystyle \\sigma_1=\\hat x} , {\\displaystyle \\sigma_2 =\\hat y} {\\displaystyle \\sigma_2 =\\hat y} , {\\displaystyle \\sigma_3 = \\hat z} {\\displaystyle \\sigma_3 = \\hat z} , such that MAGMOM can be given in Cartesian coordinates. The orientation of MAGMOM with respect to the lattice only matters if spin-orbit coupling is included ( LSORBIT ). Examples The most simple input for a bcc cell with antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin alignment would be the following. If you have problems converging to a desired magnetic solution, try to calculate first the non-magnetic ground state and continue from the generated WAVECAR and CHGCAR . To restart, e.g., a calculation with two atoms that have equally large and antiferromagnetically coupled on-site magnetic moments, you need to set the following in the INCAR file: For systems containing many atoms, MAGMOM input on a single line can be hard to read, especially in the noncollinear case. It is possible to provide INCAR input on multiple lines using backslashes ( \\ ) as linebreaks. E.g. for a noncollinear system with AFM alignment and 16 atoms (the first 8 of them magnetic), the multi-line input could look like this: Related Tags and Sections ISPIN , LNONCOLLINEAR , LSORBIT , SAXIS , LORBIT , I_CONSTRAINED_M Examples that use this tag"

For the Kerker scheme ( IMIX =1) either AMIX or BMIX can be optimized, but we recommend to change only BMIX and keep AMIX fixed (you must decrease BMIX if the mean eigenvalue is larger than one, and increase BMIX if the mean eigenvalue \u0393 mean <1).

VASP uses an additional support grid for the evaluation of the augmentation charges. This grid contains 8 times more points than the standard \"fine\" grid ( NGXF x NGYF x NGZF ). Whenever terms involving augmentation charges are evaluated, this additional grid is used. For instance: The augmentation charge is evaluated first in real space on this additional grid, FFT-transformed to reciprocal space, and then added to the total charge density on the standard \"fine\" grid ( NGXF x NGYF x NGZF ). The additional grid often helps to reduce the noise in the forces. In some cases, it even allows to perform calculations with NGXF = NGX . Caveat: If there is any contribution in the density or potential at the highest Fourier component {\\displaystyle G} {\\displaystyle G} of the conventional fine grid (given by NGXF x NGYF x NGZF ), then Fourier interpolation to twice the grid density leads to oscillations in real space. These oscillations correspond to the largest wave vector {\\displaystyle G_{cut} } {\\displaystyle G_{cut} } i.e. {\\displaystyle e^{i G_{cut} r}} {\\displaystyle e^{i G_{cut} r}} . In real space, the charge density or potential will therefore alternate between positive and negative values on the ultra-fine grid, in particular, in regions where the density or potential are small. The terminus techniques is \"termination wiggles\". Although this is a somewhat oversimplified presentation, it is fairly straightforward to derive more rigorous results in 1D. The upshot is that Fourier-interpolation can lead to termination wiggles with oscillations {\\displaystyle e^{i G_{cut} r}} {\\displaystyle e^{i G_{cut} r}} in the interpolated potential (where {\\displaystyle G_{cut}} {\\displaystyle G_{cut}} corresponds to the largest Fourier components on the fine grid).

How normalizing and weighting are performed can be controlled with the ML_IWEIGHT together with weighting parameters ML_WTOTEN , ML_WTIFOR and ML_WTSIF for energies, forces, and stresses, respectively. The following procedures can be selected via ML_IWEIGHT : ML_IWEIGHT = 1: Manual control over normalization/weighting: the unnormalized energies, forces, and stress tensor training data are divided by the weights determined by the flags ML_WTOTEN (eV/atom), ML_WTIFOR (eV/ {\\displaystyle \\AA} {\\displaystyle \\AA} ) and ML_WTSIF (kBar), respectively. ML_IWEIGHT = 2: Normalization via global standard deviations: The energies, forces, and stresses are normalized by their respective standard deviation over the entire training data. Then, the normalized quantities are weighted by ML_WTOTEN , ML_WTIFOR and ML_WTSIF when they are processed for learning in the design matrix {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\Phi}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\Phi}} (see this section ). In this case the values of ML_WTOTEN , ML_WTIFOR and ML_WTSIF are unitless quantities. ML_IWEIGHT = 3: Normalization via averages over subset standard deviations: Same as ML_IWEIGHT = 2 but the training data is divided into individual subsets. For each subset, the standard deviations are calculated separately. Then, the energies, forces, and stresses are normalized using the average of the standard deviations of all subsets. Finally, as for ML_IWEIGHT = 2 the normalized quantities are multiplied by ML_WTOTEN , ML_WTIFOR and ML_WTSIF for learning purposes. By default ( ML_LUSE_NAMES = .FALSE. ) the division into subsets is based on the atom types and number of atoms per type. If two systems contain the same atom types and the same number of atoms per type then they are considered to be in the same subset. To further divide them into subsets set ML_LUSE_NAMES = .TRUE. and choose different system names in the first line of the POSCAR file. This can be useful if training is performed for widely different materials, for instance, different phases with widely different energies. Without the finer subset assignment, the overall energy standard deviation might become large, reducing the weight of the energies too much of given subsets. For ML_IWEIGHT = 2, 3 the weights are unitless quantities used to multiply the data, whereas for ML_IWEIGHT = 1 they have a unit. All three methods provide unitless energies, forces, and stress tensors, which are then passed to the learning algorithm. Although the defaults are usually rather sensible, it can be useful to explore different weights. For instance, if vibrational frequencies are supposed to be reproduced accurately, we found it helpful to increase ML_WTIFOR to 10-100. On the other hand, if the energy difference between different phases needs to be described accurately by the force field, it might be useful to increase ML_WTOTEN to around 10-100.

    "description": "Selects a projection method onto local quantum numbers ( {\\displaystyle lm} {\\displaystyle lm} ) and writes PROCAR / PROOUT file. When LORBIT is set, VASP performs a post-processing step of the Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals to decompose the KS orbitals into local quantum numbers ( {\\displaystyle lm} {\\displaystyle lm} ) and obtain local properties, e.g., the on-site charge density or on-site magnetic moments due to the spin degrees of freedom. The decomposition is achieved by means of one of several projection methods selected by LORBIT . All these projections rely on the fact that most of the charge density is close to the ion center, and interstitial regions separate them well. This is merely a qualitative approach in contrast to performing a wannierization in order to obtain a localized basis, but often it serves as a good estimate. For VASP version < 6 with LORBIT >= 11 and ISYM = 2, see known issues . Projection methods See the table for an overview: For LORBIT < 10 The projection is onto spherical harmonics at each ionic site within a sphere defined by RWIGS . The radius must be specified for each atomic species, and there is some uncertainty introduced depending on the size of the sphere. For LORBIT >= 10 The projection uses the projector functions that are provided by the PAW method . This is, of course, still a qualitative approach because also, for the PAW projectors, the radius was somehow defined, and it is not guaranteed to be the best choice for that particular system as it depends on the chemical composition and crystal or molecular structure. Phase factors For LORBIT >=12: The phase factors written by VASP can usually only be used as a qualitative measure of the projection of the orbitals into the atomic sphere. The main issue is that most VASP POTCAR files have two or three projectors per {\\displaystyle l} {\\displaystyle l} -quantum number, and projecting an orbital onto two projectors will yield two complex numbers. VASP combines these two numbers into a single number. The precise algorithms differ in different versions of VASP, and we recommend that you inspect the source code for more details. From vasp.6 onward, an improved scheme has been implemented and can be selected using LORBIT =14. In this case, VASP first selects a single projector for each {\\displaystyle l} {\\displaystyle l} -quantum number by linearly combining all projectors with the same {\\displaystyle l} {\\displaystyle l} -quantum number. This is done in such a way that the new projector is optimally chosen to represent the calculated orbitals in the energy interval specified by EMAX and EMIN . In the second step, VASP projects onto these optimized projectors, yielding a single complex number for each orbital, site and {\\displaystyle l} {\\displaystyle l} -quantum number, which is written to the PROCAR file. For details we also refer to  . LORBIT =12 should no longer be used except for qualitative calculations. LORBIT=13 chooses the projectors also automatically, but allows for different optimal linear combinations for each orbital. Note that this is generally not desirable, since the resultant projection is not compatible with the required properties of a projection operator (a projection operator needs to use energy and orbital independent projectors). Hence, do not use LORBIT =13 for anything but a qualitative analysis. LORBIT =13 and LORBIT =14 are only supported by version >=5.4.4. On-site partial charge densities and magnetization The partial charge densities can be found in the OUTCAR Here, the first column corresponds to the ion index {\\displaystyle \\alpha} {\\displaystyle \\alpha} , the s, p, d,... columns correspond to the partial charges for {\\displaystyle l=0,1,2,\\cdots} {\\displaystyle l=0,1,2,\\cdots} defined as {\\displaystyle \\rho_{\\alpha l}=\\frac{1}{N_{\\bf k}} \\sum_{n{\\bf k}}f_{n{\\bf k}} \\sum_{m=-l}^{l}|\\langle Y_{lm}^{\\alpha}|\\phi_{n\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle|^2 } {\\displaystyle \\rho_{\\alpha l}=\\frac{1}{N_{\\bf k}} \\sum_{n{\\bf k}}f_{n{\\bf k}} \\sum_{m=-l}^{l}|\\langle Y_{lm}^{\\alpha}|\\phi_{n\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle|^2 } The {\\displaystyle \\langle Y_{lm}^{\\alpha}|\\phi_{n\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle} {\\displaystyle \\langle Y_{lm}^{\\alpha}|\\phi_{n\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle} are obtained from the projection of the (occupied) KS orbitals {\\displaystyle |\\phi_{n{\\bf k}}\\rangle} {\\displaystyle |\\phi_{n{\\bf k}}\\rangle} onto spherical harmonics that are non zero within spheres of a radius RWIGS centered at ion {\\displaystyle \\alpha} {\\displaystyle \\alpha} and the last column is the sum {\\displaystyle \\sum_{l}\\rho_{\\alpha l}} {\\displaystyle \\sum_{l}\\rho_{\\alpha l}} . Note that depending on the system, an \"f\" column is written as well. In case of spin-polarized magnetic calculations ( ISPIN =2), the partial magnetization densities are written to the OUTCAR Here, the magnetization density is calculated from the difference in the up and down spin channel {\\displaystyle m^{\\alpha l}_z = \\rho_{\\alpha l}^{\\uparrow}-\\rho_{\\alpha l}^{\\downarrow} } {\\displaystyle m^{\\alpha l}_z = \\rho_{\\alpha l}^{\\uparrow}-\\rho_{\\alpha l}^{\\downarrow} } Although the direction of the magnetization densities is meaningless in a spin-polarized calculation (no spin-orbit coupling, see LSORBIT ), here the projection axis is the z-axis. This is consistent withe the behavior upon restarting a noncollinear calculation from a spin-polarized one with default SAXIS . In case of noncollinear calculations ( LNONCOLLINEAR =.TRUE.), the lines after \"total charge\" correspond to the diagonal average {\\displaystyle \\frac{\\rho_{\\alpha l}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow} - \\rho_{\\alpha l}^{\\downarrow \\downarrow}}{2} } {\\displaystyle \\frac{\\rho_{\\alpha l}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow} - \\rho_{\\alpha l}^{\\downarrow \\downarrow}}{2} } of the density tensor which is determined from the projected components of the spinor {\\displaystyle |\\Psi_{n{\\bf k}}\\rangle=\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\chi_{n{\\bf k}}^\\uparrow \\\\\\chi_{n{\\bf k}}^\\downarrow \\end{matrix}\\right)} {\\displaystyle |\\Psi_{n{\\bf k}}\\rangle=\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\chi_{n{\\bf k}}^\\uparrow \\\\\\chi_{n{\\bf k}}^\\downarrow \\end{matrix}\\right)} Similarly, the lines after \"magnetization (x)\", \"magnetization (y)\", and \"magnetization (z)\"correspond to the partial magnetization density projected onto Pauli matrices {\\displaystyle \\{\\sigma_1} {\\displaystyle \\{\\sigma_1} , {\\displaystyle \\sigma_2} {\\displaystyle \\sigma_2} , {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\sigma}_3\\}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{\\sigma}_3\\}} .

    "description": "This tag selects the mode of operation (e.g. start from scratch, prediction-only,...) of the machine learning force fields method. If the machine learning force fields method is enabled via ML_LMLFF = .TRUE., this tag further specifies the mode of operation when VASP is run. The following cases can be selected: ML_ISTART = 0: On-the-fly learning is enabled, starting from scratch. Force predictions from the machine learning force field are used to drive the MD simulation. However, if the error estimation performed in each time step indicates a high force error an ab initio calculation is performed instead and the collected energy, forces and stress are used to improve the machine learning force field. Setting ML_ISTART = 0 starts the machine learning force field from scratch. Hence, in the beginning of the MD run there is no force field available and ab initio calculations will happen frequently. ML_ISTART = 1: Same as ML_ISTART = 0 but taking into account pre-existing ab initio data. This is the usual choice for continuing a previous MD simulation with activated machine learning. Before the MD run starts the ML_AB file, copied from ML_ABN from a previous run, is read and the contained ab initio energies, forces and stresses are used to generate an initial force field. Note that this preparative learning step adopts the previous choice of local reference configurations, i.e. the reference atomic environments entering the kernel are taken from a list in the ML_AB file. Then, the MD simulation is started with on-the-fly learning enabled. The ML_AB file does not necessarily need to contain structures matching the current starting configuration in the POSCAR file in terms of simulation box, present elements or number of atoms. However, if the same elements appear the initial force field is of course used for predictions. In any case the provided training data is included in the finally generated machine learning force field, i.e. the ML_FFN file will define a force field applicable to both, the structures in the ML_AB file and the current MD simulation. By restarting repeatedly with ML_ISTART = 1 while providing an ML_AB file from the last run it is possible to iteratively extend the applicability of the resulting machine learning force field, e.g. by exploring different temperature ranges or element compositions. ML_ISTART = 2: Prediction only. In this mode the previously trained machine learning force field is read from the ML_FF file. The MD simulation is driven with predictions from the force field only, no ab initio calculations are performed and no learning is executed. However, in order to monitor the quality of predictions the Bayesian error estimate of forces is still computed and logged in the ML_LOGFILE . This setting is typically used when the machine learning force field is considered mature and ready for production runs. ML_ISTART = 3: Learning from given ab initio data only, no MD time steps. In this operation mode a new machine learning force field is generated from ab initio data provided in the ML_AB file. The structures are read in and processed one by one as if harvested via an MD simulation. In other words, the same steps are performed as in on-the-fly training but the source of data is not an MD run but the series of structures available in ML_AB . This operation mode can be used to generate VASP machine learning force fields from pre-computed or external ab initio data sets. At first glance ML_ISTART = 3 looks very similar to the combination of ML_ISTART = 1 and NSW = 0 described above. However, there is an important difference: Setting ML_ISTART = 3 will ignore the list of local reference configurations in the ML_AB file and instead will determine a new collection which is written to the resulting ML_ABN file. ML_ISTART = 4: Refitting of the force field is done based on an existing ML_AB file, but the number of local reference configurations is taken from the ML_AB file. NSW on the input is ignored and only a single step is executed. No ab-initio calculation is carried out.

If this is not the case, the values are extremely sensitive with respect to changes in {\\displaystyle \\mathbf R_{\\rm center}} {\\displaystyle \\mathbf R_{\\rm center}} . In such cases, it might be beneficial to increase the size of the cell along the vacuum dimension (for surfaces) or for the entire cell (for isolated molecules). For practical purposes this means that for slab calculations or surfaces the position specified by DIPOL should roughly correspond to the center of mass of the atoms in the cell, so that there is enough vacuum for the field to dissipate.

    "description": "Decides how the error threshold ( ML_CTIFOR ) is updated within the machine learning force field method. ML_CTIFOR determines whether a first-principles calculation is performed. The use of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: here . The following options are possible for ML_ICRITERIA : ML_ICRITERIA = 0: The threshold ML_CTIFOR is not updated. This method is the only method used for ML_CALGO =1. For ML_CALGO =0, this method is only recommended for refining an existing force field. For example, if you know that ML_CTIFOR has taken a value of 0.03 in previous runs, you can continue to collect training data by now setting the threshold to ML_CTIFOR =0.03 to capture all contours and areas of the potential energy surface where first-principles data are still missing. To achieve extremely robust force fields, it is recommended to run NSW =100000 steps in this mode to slightly above the highest temperature to be considered. ML_ICRITERIA = 1: Set ML_CTIFOR to a value proportional to the average errors of the ML_MHIS steps. ML_ICRITERIA = 1, the average is calculated only for errors after updating the force field. Such updates are quite rare, so updates of ML_CTIFOR are also quite rare in this mode. Furthermore, since the first principle calculations are only performed for configurations with large errors (\"outliers\"), the force field is updated only after the outliers are taken into account. Therefore, the errors included in the averaging are typically larger than the average error in this mode. It is therefore recommended to set ML_CX to 0 (default) in this mode. ML_ICRITERIA = 2: Update the criteria using the moving average of all previous errors. This method gives the average of the errors of all previous predictions (i.e. all previously considered MD steps), while ML_ICRITERIA = 1 gives only the average of the predictions immediately following the retraining. The length of the history in this mode is currently hard-coded and set to 400 steps (or ML_MHIS x 50 in the newer version). This mode tends to continue sampling, and is therefore somewhat prone to oversampling: as errors decrease, the threshold is steadily lowered and additional first-principles computations are initiated. The recommended values for ML_CX in this mode are approximately 0.1 to 0.3. = 0,2, a first-principles calculation is typically performed every 50 steps. This means that if the number of ionic steps is, say, NSW =50,000, then about 1,000 first-principles calculations should be performed. For many materials, this results in a reasonably good and robust ML database. ML_ICRITERIA =3: This mode is the default for reselecting local reference configurations from an existing ML_AB file ( ML_MODE = SELECT ). The ML_AB file shall contain a ML_CTIFOR for each structure stored in the ML_AB file. These values are used by VASP as error thresholds for structure selection. This also means that the tags ML_CTIFOR , ML_CX , ML_CSLOPE , ML_CSIG and ML_MHIS set in INCAR are ignored. This mode is only available when ML_MODE = SELECT is activated. It is important that the ML_AB file contains a ML_CTIFOR value for each structure included. Otherwise, VASP will throw an error and will also indicate to the user that some ML_CTIFOR values are missing from the ML_AB file. As mentioned above, the ML_CX tag can be used to fine-tune the update of ML_CTIFOR . The fact that the ML_ICRITERIA = 1 or ML_ICRITERIA = 2 is a matter of taste. Just remember that ML_CX must be set differently in both modes. While ML_ICRITERIA = 1, the ML_CX = 0.0, ML_ICRITERIA = 2, ML_CX = 0.2 is a good default. Most of our force fields use ML_ICRITERIA = 1, but this mode sometimes stagnates and stops the first principle calculations. On the other hand, and as already mentioned, using ML_ICRITERIA = 2 is prone to oversampling, i.e. it may perform too many first principle calculations.

    "description": "calculate RPA natural orbitals. This flag should be used in combination with ALGO = G0W0R or ALGO = scGW0R. The VASP code diagonalizes the RPA density matrix and writes the final natural orbitals to the WAVECAR file. The one-electron occupancies on the WAVECAR file can also be updated to the eigenvalues of the RPA density matrix. For ALGO = G0W0R, the interacting Green's function is approximated as {\\displaystyle G = G_0 + G_0 \\Sigma G_0 } {\\displaystyle G = G_0 + G_0 \\Sigma G_0 } whereas for ALGO = scGW0R the Dyson equation is solved {\\displaystyle G = G_0 + G \\Sigma G_0. } {\\displaystyle G = G_0 + G \\Sigma G_0. } In both cases, the RPA density matrix is determined as {\\displaystyle \\gamma= \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^-} G(\\tau) } {\\displaystyle \\gamma= \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^-} G(\\tau) } . More details on the use of RPA natural orbitals can be found in Ref.  . The following settings are currently supported NATURALO =0 calculate the density matrix, diagonalize the matrix and write the natural orbitals and eigenvalues of the density matrix to WAVECAR . The eigenvalues of the density matrix are stored in the occupancy entries of the WAVECAR file, whereas the one-electron DFT eigenvalues remain untouched. This setting is usually not particularly useful for practical calculations and should be used only by experts. Furthermore, LFINITE_TEMPERATURE should not be combined with this setting. NATURALO =1 calculate the density matrix, diagonalize the matrix only in the sub-block of unoccupied states, and write the occupied Kohn Sham orbitals, as well as the natural orbitals corresponding to unoccupied states to the file WAVECAR . The unoccupied orbitals are ordered according to their occupancies in the RPA density matrix. The one-electron occupancies and KS-DFT eigenvalues are not updated from their KS values (the occupancies will remain 1 for occupied Kohn-Sham orbitals and 0 for natural orbitals representing the virtual manifold). This setting has been used in Ref.  . See also Ref.  for further information. Note that all orbitals- even those with a tiny fractional occupancy -are treated as occupied orbitals and not updated: the algorithm should hence even work for metallic systems. NATURALO <0. Similar to NATURALO =1 but additionally conserves ABS| NATURALO | unoccupied Kohn-Sham states. This is expedient, for subsequent GW and BSE calculations to conserve few unoccupied orbitals to their Kohn-Sham states. If 10 is added (e.g. NATURALO =10, NATURALO =11) the density matrix is diagonalizes using a perturbative Loewdin algorithm that attempts to keep the orbital order strictly conserved: E.g. the natural orbital matching closest to each Kohn-Sham orbital will be determined and stored. Use this tag for metals. NATURALO =2 (or 12) is similar to 0, but the one-electron occupancies are not updated. In rare cases this might lead to inconsistencies, if the orbital order changes between DFT and the RPA density matrix (i.e. a previously occupied DFT orbitals posses a smaller occupation in the RPA density matrix than some unoccupied Kohn-Sham orbitals and are moved into the unoccupied block). This problem can be reduced using NATURALO =12, as described above. This flag, in combination with ALGO = scGW0R, can be used to evaluate the GW-singles contribution to the correlation energy.  One can deduct the HF singles and the GW singles energies from the energies after Experience has shown that there is very little difference between the natural orbitals obtained using ALGO = G0W0R and ALGO = scGW0R. We strongly recommend to use the more efficient and better tested algorithm ALGO = G0W0R (with the exception of GW-singles) to determine natural orbitals. Furthermore, perform careful tests for NOMEGA : the RPA total energy converges much faster then the natural orbitals. Using a too small NOMEGA can yield natural orbitals that are non-optimal, leading to very slow convergence of correlated calculations with respect to the number of natural orbitals. A crucial test is that the following line in the stdout and OUTCAR file shows values close to zero (for ALGO = G0W0R). The above value is perfectly acceptable and the value decreases as NOMEGA increases. NATURALO =4 preserves original (DFT) orbitals but updates the eigenvalues in the WAVECAR file to the QP energies. This mode is useful if only quasi-particle energies are corrected with the GW method, for instance when selecting ALGO = EVGW0R .

The electronic minimization treats the full 2x2 spin density  which is written to the CHGCAR file. In spinor space, the part of the spin density proportional to the 2x2 unit matrix corresponds to the charge density, and the part proportional to the vector of Pauli matrices is the magnetization density. This enables the consideration of noncollinear magnetic structures within spin-density-functional theory. MAGMOM sets the initial magnetic moments. Write the final magnetic moments by setting LORBIT . It is possible to restart a noncollinear calculation from a previous nonmagnetic calculation ( ISPIN =1 and LNONCOLLINEAR =F) or spin-polarized calculation ( ISPIN =2) by reading WAVECAR or CHGCAR files. The magnetization of the spin-polarized calculation is interpreted to point along SAXIS (default: Cartesian direction {\\displaystyle \\hat z} {\\displaystyle \\hat z} ). It is not possible to rotate the magnetic moment locally on selected atoms when restarting with a magnetization density. The magnetic configuration can globally be rotated with respect to the lattice by restarting with a different SAXIS . In practice, we recommend performing noncollinear calculations in two steps: First, calculate the nonmagnetic ground state and generate a WAVECAR and a CHGCAR file. Second, read the WAVECAR and CHGCAR file, and supply initial magnetic moments using the MAGMOM tag. We recommend setting GGA_COMPAT = False and LASPH = True for noncollinear calculations since this improves the numerical precision of calculations using the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA). Consider setting AMIX_MAG and BMIX_MAG for better convergence when using density mixing . The I_CONSTRAINED_M tag can constrain the on-site magnetic moments. Supported as of VASP.4.5.

For LMAXPAW = -1 , no one-center correction terms are evaluated on the radial support grid, which effectively means that the behavior of US-PP's is recovered with PAW input datasets. Usually, this allows for somewhat faster calculations, and this switch might be of interest for relaxations and molecular dynamics runs. Energies should be evaluated with the default setting for LMAXPAW . For spinpolarized calculations, results using LMAXPAW=-1 might differ significantly from conventional PAW calculations, hence the use of LMAXPAW = -1 is not recommended for magnetic materials, spin-polarized molecules or atoms.

PREC sets default values for the energy cutoff ENCUT , the FFT grids ( NGX , NGY , NGZ ) and ( NGXF , NGYF , NGZF ), and the accuracy of the projectors in real space ROPT (used only when LREAL =.TRUE.). Details are given below in the table. We recommend using PREC =Normal or PREC =Accurate. PREC =Normal can be used for most routine calculations. PREC =Accurate leads to a denser grid ( NGX , NGY , NGZ ). Thus, it reduces egg-box effects and strictly avoids any aliasing/wrap-around errors . PREC =Normal and PREC =Accurate use an augmentation fine grid ( NGXF , NGYF , NGZF ) that is twice larger than the grid ( NGX , NGY , NGZ ) used for the representation of the pseudo-orbitals. PREC =Accurate increases the memory requirements somewhat, but it should be used (in combination with an increased value for ENCUT ) when a very good accuracy is required, e.g., for accurate forces, for phonons and stress tensor or in general when second derivatives are computed. The accuracy of forces can also be sometimes further improved by specifying ADDGRID =.TRUE., however, reports from users are somewhat contradictory about whether this really helps. Default values set by PREC Default values set by PREC for the parameters ENCUT , ( NGX , NGY , NGZ ), ( NGXF , NGYF , NGZF ) and ROPT : where max( ENMAX ) and max( ENMIN ) are the maxima of ENMAX and ENMIN found in the POTCAR file, and {\\displaystyle G_{\\rm cut}} {\\displaystyle G_{\\rm cut}} and {\\displaystyle G_{\\rm aug}} {\\displaystyle G_{\\rm aug}} are defined by with {\\displaystyle E_{\\rm cut}} {\\displaystyle E_{\\rm cut}} = ENCUT and {\\displaystyle E_{\\rm aug}} {\\displaystyle E_{\\rm aug}} = ENAUG . Further remarks With PREC =Normal, Single, and Accurate the grid ( NGXF , NGYF , NGZF ) representing the augmentation charges, charge densities and potentials has either the same size ( PREC =Single) or the double size ( PREC =Normal or Accurate) as the grid ( NGX , NGY , NGZ ). With the deprecated (and no longer recommended) settings for PREC (Low, Medium and High), the grid ( NGXF , NGYF , NGZF ) is determined by some heuristic formula from ENAUG . PREC =Single uses the same grid ( NGX , NGY , NGZ ) as PREC =Normal in VASP.5, but the same grid as PREC =Accurate in VASP.6. However, the double grid technique is not used, i.e., ( NGXF , NGYF , NGZF )=( NGX , NGY , NGZ ). This is convenient if one needs to cut down on storage demands or if one wants to reduce the size of the files CHG and CHGCAR . Furthermore, PREC =Single avoids high-frequency oscillations caused by the double-grid technique and the resulting Fourier interpolation. It is often expedient for scanning tunneling simulations or other calculations where high-frequency wiggles of the charge density in the vacuum region are undesirable. PREC =Medium and PREC =Normal should usually be sufficiently accurate and lead to errors of less than 1 meV/atom. PREC =High should guarantee that the absolute energies are converged to a few meV and the stress tensor converged within a few kBar.

It is recommended to select a \"direct optimization\" algorithm for HF/DFT hybrid functonal type calculations, i.e., ALGO =Damped ( IALGO =53) or ALGO =All ( IALGO =58) in the INCAR file. The blocked-Davidson algorithm ALGO =Normal is, with certain caveat, also supported, whereas calculations for the other algorithms ( ALGO =Fast) are not properly supported (note: no warning is printed). The blocked-Davidson algorithm ( ALGO =Normal) is generally rather slow, and in many cases the Pulay mixer will be unable to determine the proper ground-state. We hence recommend to select the blocked-Davidson algorithm only in combination with straight mixing or a Kerker like mixing (see the section on mixing ).

Depending on their value, VASP interprets ROPT entries in one of two ways: ABS| ROPT | \u2265 0.1: \"conventional\"-mode: ABS| ROPT | < 0.1 : \"precision\"-mode: The \"precision\" and \"conventional\" modes may be intermixed, i.e., it is possible to specify In this case, the number of real space points within the cutoff sphere for the first species will be approximately 700, whereas the real space projector functions for the second species are optimized for an accuracy of approximately 1 meV. We recommend to use the \"precision\" mode with a target accuracy of around 2x10 -4 - 10 -3 eV/atom. If you use the \"conventional\" mode, in which the number of grid points in the real space projection sphere is specified, you have to select ROPT carefully, especially if a hard species is mixed with a soft species. In that case the following lines in the OUTCAR file must be checked (here is the output for LREAL =Auto, however, the one for LREAL =On is quite similar) QCUT and QGAM are parameters chosen for the generation of this particular PAW dataset (or ultrasoft pseudopotential). The most important information is given in the columns W(low)/X(q) and W(high)/X(q) for LREAL =Auto). In these columns, the values must be as small as possible. If these values are too large increase the ROPT value from the default value (or decrease it if it smaller than 0.1). As a rule of thumb, the maximum allowed value in this column is 10 -3 for PREC =Normal. (For PREC =Low errors might be around 10 -2 . If W(q)/X(q) is larger than 10 -2 the errors introduced by the real space projections can be substantial. In this case ROPT must be specified in the INCAR file to avoid incorrect results.

How to calculate X-ray absorption spectra from the supercell core-hole method are is explained here . This tag should be used in combination with the following important tags for the core-hole approximation: ICORELEVEL : To enable core-hole calculations in the final-state approximation with self-consistent field cycles (SCF) one has to set ICORELEVEL =2. Core-hole calculations in the initial-state approximation ( ICORELEVEL =1) are also available, but they are physically less relevant and should be only used if especially needed. CLNT : This tag selects the species holding the core hole. This number corresponds to the species defined in the POSCAR and POTCAR files. CLN : Specifies the {\\displaystyle n} {\\displaystyle n} quantum number of the excited electron. CLL : Specifies the {\\displaystyle l} {\\displaystyle l} quantum number of the excited electron. CLZ : Specifies how much of a faction of the chosen electron should be excited. Usually one always sets CLZ =1.0, but in some cases values lesser than 1 can lead to better agreement with experiment. However, this should be handled with caution since the physics behind is very dubious. And following tags to control the calculation of the dieletric function: CH_SIGMA : The broadening of the spectrum is by default of Gaussian form and the broadening width in eV is set by CH_SIGMA . We recommend using a very small broadening CH_SIGMA {\\displaystyle \\le} {\\displaystyle \\le} 0.001 in the calculations and to broaden the spectrum in post-processing. Also, the spectrum can be recalculated with different parameters without the need to redo the electronic self-consistent field cycle. For that one can use the converged WAVECAR from the previous calculation and set ALGO = None together with the new parameters for the spectrum \"CH_*\" in the INCAR file. CH_NEDOS : Sets the number of grid points on the energy axis of the spectrum. CH_AMPLIFICATION : Scaling of the spectrum by the specified value. This tag is not important but can be useful sometimes if one needs to scale the spectrum a priori. Otherwise, it is recommended to scale the spectrum a posteriori.

There are several algorithms for the time propagation in MD controlled by selecting MDALGO and the choice of the thermostats . The MD run performs NSW timesteps of length POTIM . Frequently, performing an ab-initio calculations in every step of an MD simulation is too expensive so that machine-learned force fields are needed. Structure optimization VASP optimizes the structure based on the degrees of freedom selected with the ISIF tag and (if used) the selective dynamics POSCAR file. Generally, the larger the number of degrees of freedom, the harder it is to find the optimal solution. To find the solution, VASP provides multiple algorithms: RMM-DIIS ( IBRION =1) reduces the forces by linear combination of previous positions. It is the method of choice for larger systems (>20 degrees of freedom) that are reasonably close to the ground-state structure. Conjugate gradient ( IBRION =2) finds the optimal step size along a search direction. It is a robust default choice but may need more iterations than RMM-DIIS. Damped molecular dynamics ( IBRION =3) runs a MD simulation with decreasing velocity of the ions. Use this for large systems far away from the minimum to get to a better starting point for the other algorithms. Consult the structure optimization page for advise on how to choose the optimization algorithm. Computing the phonon modes The second-order derivatives of the total energy {\\displaystyle E} {\\displaystyle E} with respect to ionic positions {\\displaystyle R_{\\alpha i}} {\\displaystyle R_{\\alpha i}} of ion {\\displaystyle \\alpha} {\\displaystyle \\alpha} in the direction {\\displaystyle i} {\\displaystyle i} , is computed using a first-order derivative of the forces {\\displaystyle F_{\\beta j}} {\\displaystyle F_{\\beta j}} . Then, the dynamical matrix {\\displaystyle D_{\\alpha i \\beta j}} {\\displaystyle D_{\\alpha i \\beta j}} is constructed, diagonalized, and the phonon modes and frequencies of the system are reported in the OUTCAR file and vaspout.h5 . Also see theory on phonons . VASP implements two different methods to compute the phonon modes and can use symmetry to reduce the number of computed displacements: IBRION = 5 finite differences without symmetry IBRION = 6 finite differences with symmetry IBRION = 7 density-functional-perturbation theory without symmetry IBRION = 8 density-functional-perturbation theory with symmetry For finite differences, the elastic tensors and internal strain tensors is computed for ISIF >=3. Compute Born-effective charges, piezoelectric constants, and the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor by specifying LEPSILON = .TRUE. ( linear response theory ) or LCALCEPS = .TRUE. (finite external field). Also see computing the phonon dispersion and DOS . Analyzing transition states To study the kinetics of chemical reactions, one may want to construct transition states or follow the reaction path. For the analysis of transition states the following methods are available: Setting IBRION = 40 , you can start from a transition state and monitor the energy along an intrinsic-reaction coordinate (IRC). The IRC calculations section describes this method. With the improved dimer method ( IBRION = 44 ), you can search for a the transition state starting from an arbitrary structure in the investigated phase space. The nudged elastic bands method finds an approximate reaction path based on the initial and final structure, i.e., reactant and product. Interactively supplied positions and lattice vectors Occasionally, you may want to run VASP for related structures where the overhead of restarting VASP is significant. In these scenarios, VASP provides the following alternatives With IBRION = 11 , you can provide new structures via the standard input. For ISIF >=3, a complete POSCAR file is read, otherwise just the positions in fractional coordinates. If you linked VASP with Python , you can write a Python plugin to modify the structure.

In systems with periodic boundary conditions, the Coulomb energy and the Coulomb potential are usually evaluated under the assumption of a compensating background by introducing a compensation charge density. This is well-justified for the Hartree energy, where the compensation charge density stems from the ions. Yet, this assumption is not valid for the Fock exchange, which causes an error. For the Fock exchange potential and energy, one can correct the resulting error by assuming that the density matrix is local. The leading order correction is given by the difference between the electrostatic energy of a localized model charge density in a homogeneous background periodically repeated and the same model charge density in isolation. For details we refer to J. Paier et al.,  Section II. D. 4. HFRCUT = 0: Ewald summation or method of Massida, Posternak, and Baldereschi depending on k-mesh   HFRCUT = -1: Automated cutoff radius  HFRCUT = : Manually set cutoff radius in Angstromngstr\u00f6m. In the limit of many k-points, both methods ( HFRCUT =-1 and HFRCUT =0) should yield identical results. In our experience, the HFRCUT =-1 converges more rapidly for systems with a gap, as well as molecules and atoms, whereas HFRCUT =0 converges faster for metallic systems. It is expedient to first converge the energies with respect to the number of k-points for both methods and then select for subsequent calculations the method that converges more rapidly. A detailed comparison of the convergence of the different methods for metallic and gapped materials was made by Sundararaman and Arias  .

If the material is non-metallic and polar (i.e. two or more atoms in the unit cell carry nonzero Born effective charge tensors), a special treatment of the long-range dipole-dipole interaction is required to obtain a smooth phonon dispersion. This is activated by setting LPHON_POLAR =.TRUE. and supplying the static dielectric tensor ( PHON_DIELECTRIC ) and the Born-effective charges ( PHON_BORN_CHARGES ) which can be obtained in a separate VASP calculation using the LEPSILON or LCALCEPS tag.

ML_SCLC_CTIFOR determines how many local-reference configurations are added to the sparse representation of the kernel. Specifically, the local environment of those atoms with an estimated error larger than ML_SCLC_CTIFOR * ML_CTIFOR are added as candidates for the sparse representational of the kernel. Note that changing ML_SCLC_CTIFOR does not change the decision of whether a first-principles calculation is carried out or not, since this decision is entirely based on ML_CTIFOR . The default value of 0.6 is often a reasonably good compromise. If the value is decreased, obviously more functions are used for the sparse representation of the kernel. This always improves the initial learning efficiency but might slow the force-field calculations. So ML_SCLC_CTIFOR compromises either learning efficiency or the speed of the evaluation of the MLFF. For polymers and liquids, we found that decreasing ML_SCLC_CTIFOR to values around 0.4 (or even smaller) can significantly improve learning efficiency.

EFIELD_PEAD is specified in units of eV/Angstrom. If is set, with | \u03b5 |>0, VASP will first determine the zero-field groundstate of the system, and subsequently switch on the electric field and compute the field-polarized groundstate orbitals. Additionally, from the change in the macroscopic electronic polarization due to the applied electric field, VASP calculates (part of) the components on the diagonal of the ion-clamped static dielectric tensor (\u03b5 \u221e ), in accordance with: Beware: this option is only useful if one is interested in selected components on the diagonal of the ion-clamped dielectric tensor (for instance, in cubic systems). To calculate the full ion-clamped dielectric tensor of a system from field-polarized calculations, use LCALCEPS =.TRUE.. Note : One should be aware that when the electric field is chosen to be too large, the electric enthalpy functional will lose its minima, and VASP will not be able to find a stationary solution for the field-polarized orbitals. This is discussed in some detail by Souza et al. .  VASP will produce a warning if: where E gap is the bandgap, a i are the lattice vectors, and N i is the number of k -points along the reciprocal lattice vector i , in the regular ( N 1 x N 2 x N 3 ) k -mesh. The factor 1/10 is chosen to be on the safe side. If one does not include unoccupied bands, VASP is obviously not able to determine the bandgap and can not check whether the electric field might be too large. This will also produce a warning message. An example: \u03b5 \u221e in NaF Using the following INCAR file: KPOINTS file: POSCAR file: and LDA Na_sv and F PAW datasets. With the input above, running VASP should produce something akin to: where one can discern three distinct blocks of SCF iterations. The first one (steps marked with DAV ) corresponds to the calculation of the zero-field groundstate. After this groundstate has been reached, the k -point mesh is regenerated using a set of symmetry operations, which takes into account that the symmetry of the system is possibly reduced by the applied electric field. In most cases the new set of k -points is larger than the original one. The orbitals at the additional k -points are generated from their symmetry equivalent counterparts in the zero-field case. This expanded set of orbitals is now reoptimized until convergence is better than EDIFF /100 (the second block, marked DMP ), and the initial electronic polarization is computed. Then the electric field is switched on, and the field-polarized groundstate is calculated. This is the last block of steps marked with DMP. From the change in the electronic dipole moment due to the electric field VASP computes (part of) the components on the diagonal of the ion-clamped static dielectric tensor. This information is found both in the OUTCAR file and on stdout : To speed up the computation of the field-polarized groundstate one may set SKIP_EDOTP =.TRUE. to avoid the recalculation of the electronic polarization at each iteration during the SCF procedure. However, the additional term in Hamiltonian (second term on the right-hand-side of the electric enthalpy functional ) has to be correctly included and can not be kept fixed. Basically this means one does not minimize the total energy but optimizes the orbitals until a stationary point is reached. A stationary point is considered to be reached as soon as the norm of the gradient on the orbitals is smaller than EDIFF /100, and the SCF procedure will stop. In the case of the previous example this will lead to: Related tags and articles SKIP_EDOTP , LCALCPOL , LCALCEPS , LPEAD , IPEAD , LBERRY , IGPAR , NPPSTR , DIPOL , Berry phases and finite electric fields Examples that use this tag References"

In this case, the spd - and site projected wave function character of each band is evaluated, and the local partial DOS (see sections PROCAR and DOSCAR ) and local magnetic moments are calculated. If LORBIT >= 10, RWIGS is ignored RWIGS must be set in calculations with constraining the local magnetic moments (see I_CONSTRAINED_M ) For mono-atomic systems RWIGS can be defined unambiguously. The sum of the volume of the spheres around each atom should be the same as the total volume of the cell (assuming that you do not have a vacuum region within your cell). This is in the spirit of atomic sphere calculations. VASP writes a line to the OUTCAR file. You should use a RWIGS value which yields a volume of approximately 100%. For systems consisting of more than one atom type , there is no unambiguous way to define RWIGS and several choices are possible. In all cases, the sum of the volume of the spheres should be close to the total volume of the cell (i.e the sum of the values given by VASP should be around 100%). One possible choice is to set RWIGS such that the overlap between the spheres is minimized. a more elaborate way is to apply a Bader-type charge analysis to estimate the radius of an atom in a specific compound. in most cases, it is simplest to choose the radius of each sphere such that they are close to the covalent radius as tabulated in most periodic tables. This simple criterion can be used in most cases, and it relies at least on some ``physical intuition . Please keep in mind that results are qualitative i.e. there is no unambiguous way to determine the location of an electron (and hence the local magnetic moments). With the current implementation, it is for instance hardly possible to determine charge transfer. What can be derived from the partial DOS is the typical character of a peak in a DOS. Quantitative results can be obtained only by careful comparison with a reference system (e.g. bulk versus surface).

This allows to perform structure optimization at a specific external pressure. In molecular-dynamics calculations within the NpT ensemble , PSTRESS controls the target pressure for the Parinello-Rahman   barostat. Generally, if a negative value is supplied, the system is under effective tensile strain and during relaxations (or molecular dynamics simulations) the volume will increase. If a positive value is supplied, the system is under compressive strain; this will decrease the volume during relaxations and molecular dynamics simulations. PSTRESS can also be used to correct errors caused by the Pulay stress, i.e., errors in the calculated stress tensor caused by the incomplete plane wave basis set. To correct for Pulay-stress errors, set PSTRESS to the negative value of the Pulay stress. The Pulay stress is computed by taking the difference between the external pressure at the desired cutoff and a very large energy cutoff (check the lines 'external pressure' in the OUTCAR file and calculate pressure at cutoff you want to use {\\displaystyle - } {\\displaystyle - } pressure at large cutoff; this must be a negative value).

Determines the static ion-clamped dielectric matrix using density functional perturbation theory. The dielectric matrix is calculated with and without local field effects. Usually local field effects are determined on the Hartree level, i.e. including changes of the Hartree potential. To include microscopic changes of the exchange correlation potential the tag LRPA =.FALSE. must be set. The method is explained in detail in paper by Gajdo\u0161 et al. ,  and closely follows the original work of Baroni and Resta.  A summation over empty conduction band states is not required, instead the usual expressions in perturbation theory ( LOPTICS =.TRUE.), are rewritten as linear Sternheimer equations: The solution of this equation involves similar iterative techniques as the conventional selfconsistency cycles. Hence, for each element of the dielectric matrix several lines will be written to the stdout and OSZICAR . These possess a similar structure as for conventional selfconsistent or non-selfconsistent calculations (a residual minimization scheme is used to solve the linear equation, other schemes such as Davidson do not apply to a linear equation): It is important to note that exact values for the dielectric matrix are obtained even if only valence band states are calculated. Hence this method does not require to increase the NBANDS parameter. The final values for the static dielectric matrix can be found in the OUTCAR file after the lines and The values found after MACROSCOPIC STATIC DIELECTRIC TENSOR (excluding local field effects) should match exactly to the zero frequency values \u03c9->0 determined by the method selected using LOPTICS =.TRUE..

Simply execute VASP using LEPSILON =.TRUE. in order to determine the exact values for the dielectric constants. Next, switch to LOPTICS =.TRUE. and increase the number of conduction bands until the same values are obtained as using density functional perturbation theory. Note that the routine also parses and uses the value supplied in the LNABLA tag. Furthermore, the routine calculates the Born effective charge tensor (dynamical charges) and electronic contribution to the piezoelectric tensor , and prints them after and if LRPA =.FALSE. is set (the calculated tensors are not sensible in the random phase approximation LRPA =.TRUE.).

LMODELHF =.TRUE. selects the range separated hybrid functional suggested in Ref.  and Ref.  under the name dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals (DDH) and doubly screened hybrid (DSH) functionals, respectively. These two hybrid functionals are both based on a common model for the dielectric function, but differ in the way how the range-separation parameters are obtained from first principles calculations. Their connection and performance have been discussed for instance in Ref.  . In principle, they can be considered to be a smartly constructed approximation to COH-SEX (local Coulomb hole plus screened exchange), albeit fulfilling many important constraints that the exact exchange correlation functional must observe. The corresponding functional has been available in VASP since VASP.5.2 released in 2009 (before the two publications), although the gradient contribution had been erroneously implemented in all VASP.5 releases and is only correct in VASP.6. The related bug fix has been made available by the authors of Ref.  . The nonlocal exchange part of the functional has also been used and documented in Ref.  and is covered in Improving the dielectric function . Typically the user will need to set the following tags in the INCAR file: In this case, AEXX specifies the amount of exact exchange in the long range, that is for short wave vectors ( {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G} \\to 0 } {\\displaystyle \\mathbf{G} \\to 0 } ). In the short range, that is for large wave vectors, always the full nonlocal exchange is used. The HFSCREEN determines how quickly the nonlocal exchange changes from AEXX to 1. Specifically, in VASP, the Coulomb kernel {\\displaystyle 4 \\pi e^2 / (\\mathbf{q}+\\mathbf{G})^2} {\\displaystyle 4 \\pi e^2 / (\\mathbf{q}+\\mathbf{G})^2} in the exact exchange is multiplied by a model for the dielectric function {\\displaystyle \\epsilon^{-1} (\\mathbf{q}+\\mathbf{G})} {\\displaystyle \\epsilon^{-1} (\\mathbf{q}+\\mathbf{G})} : where {\\displaystyle \\mu } {\\displaystyle \\mu } corresponds to HFSCREEN , and {\\displaystyle {{\\varepsilon}_{\\infty}^{-1}} } {\\displaystyle {{\\varepsilon}_{\\infty}^{-1}} } is specified by AEXX . In real space this correspond to a Coulomb kernel The remaining part of the exchange is handled by an appropriate semi-local exchange correlation functional.

Typical values for HFSCREEN are listed in the table below These values have been obtained from fits of the dielectric function using the Nanoquanta kernel and partially self-consistent GW calculations as used in Ref.  . The values can be also estimated from simple dimensional scaling relations of the valence electron density. Furthermore band gap predictions are not very sensitive to the choice of HFSCREEN .

    "description": "LIBXC1_Pn , where {\\displaystyle n=1, 2, \\ldots} {\\displaystyle n=1, 2, \\ldots} allows to specify the values of the parameters of the functional implemented in Libxc that is called with LIBXC1 . For many of the functionals implemented in the library of exchange-correlation functionals Libxc    it is possible to modify the parameters if one does not want to use the default values. If a functional from Libxc has parameters that can be modified, then they are listed in OUTCAR below \"Parameters of Libxc functionals:\" as P {\\displaystyle n} {\\displaystyle n} ( {\\displaystyle n=1, 2, \\ldots} {\\displaystyle n=1, 2, \\ldots} ). LIBXC1_Pn and LIBXC2_Pn are for the functionals called with LIBXC1 and LIBXC2 , respectively. An example is given below for the GGA PBE functional  where the default parameters {\\displaystyle \\mu=0.21951} {\\displaystyle \\mu=0.21951} in exchange and {\\displaystyle \\beta=0.066725} {\\displaystyle \\beta=0.066725} in correlation are changed to {\\displaystyle \\mu=10/81\\approx0.12345679} {\\displaystyle \\mu=10/81\\approx0.12345679} and {\\displaystyle \\beta=0.046} {\\displaystyle \\beta=0.046} to get the PBEsol functional  (of course, the simpler way to use PBEsol from Libxc would be to call it directly with LIBXC1 =GGA_X_PBE_SOL and LIBXC2 =GGA_C_PBE_SOL). For Libxc functionals that are the semilocal component of a hybrid functional, i.e. those with a tag that starts with HYB ( LHFCALC =.TRUE. will be set automatically if such a functional is selected), the following explains how it works for the mixing and screening parameters: Mixing parameter: It is usually one of the parameters LIBXC1_Pn , and can therefore be modified. For HYB_GGA_XC_PBEH, HYB_GGA_XC_B1WC, HYB_GGA_XC_HSE03, HYB_GGA_XC_HSE06, HYB_GGA_XC_HSE12, and HYB_GGA_XC_HSE12S, the value of AEXX (even if not specified explicitly in INCAR ) will be used and automatically passed to the corresponding parameter in Libxc. On the other hand, if this corresponding parameter ( LIBXC1_Pn ) is specified in INCAR , then it will be used (instead of AEXX ), however note that it will be only for the semilocal component of the hybrid functional and not for the exact exchange that will still use AEXX . For all hybrid functionals except those listed just above, AEXX will not be considered for the semilocal component of the hybrid functional, but only for the exact exchange component. Therefore, a particular choice for the mixing parameter has to be done by specifying both AEXX (for the exact exchange) and the appropriate LIBXC1_Pn (for the semilocal component). The ALDAX , ALDAC , AGGAX , AGGAC , AMGGAX , and AMGGAC tags are ignored if the Libxc functional is an hybrid functional (those with a tag that starts with HYB). Screening parameter: It is usually one of the parameters LIBXC1_Pn if it is a screened functional, and can therefore be modified. For HYB_GGA_XC_HSE03, HYB_GGA_XC_HSE06, HYB_GGA_XC_HSE12, and HYB_GGA_XC_HSE12S, the value of HFSCREEN (even if not specified explicitly in INCAR ) will be used and automatically passed to the corresponding parameter in Libxc.

    "description": "NBANDS specifies the total number of KS or QP orbitals in the calculation. The right choice of NBANDS strongly depends on the type of the performed calculation and the system. As a minimum, VASP requires all occupied states + one empty band, otherwise, a warning is given. In the electronic minimization calculations, empty states do not contribute to the total energy, however, empty states are required to achieve a better convergence. In iterative matrix-diagonalization algorithms (see ALGO ) eigenvectors close to the top of the calculated number of states converge much slower than the lowest eigenstates, thus it is important to choose a sufficiently large NBANDS . Therefore, we recommend using the default settings for NBANDS , i.e., NELECT/2 + NIONS/2 , which is a safe choice in most cases. In some cases, it is also possible to decrease it to NELECT/2+NIONS/4 , however, in some transition metals with open f shells a much larger number of empty bands might be required (up to NELECT/2+2*NIONS ). To check this parameter perform several calculations for a fixed potential ( ICHARG =12) with an increasing number of bands (e.g. starting from NELECT/2 + NIONS/2 ). An accuracy of {\\displaystyle 10^{-6}} {\\displaystyle 10^{-6}} should be obtained in 10-15 iterations. In the Many-Body Perturbation Theory calculations ( GW , RPA , and BSE ), a large number of empty orbitals is usually required, which can be much higher than the number of occupied states. The convergence of the calculations with a large number of empty states can be very slow. In such cases, we recommend performing an exact diagonalization ( ALGO =Exact) of the Hamiltonian with empty bands starting from a converged charge density. When executed on multiple CPUs, VASP automatically increases the number of bands, so that NBANDS is divisible by the number of CPU cores. If NCORE > 1, NBANDS is increased until it is divisible by the number of cores in a group ( NCORE ). If KPAR > 1, NBANDS is increased until it is divisible by the number of cores in a group. In the case of spin-polarized calculations, the default value for NBANDS is increased to account for the initial magnetic moments. In noncollinear calculations, the default NBANDS value is doubled to account for the spinors components. Related tags and article NCORE , NBANDS , NBANDSGW , NBANDSV , NBANDSO , NPAR , KPAR"

The use of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: here . If ML_ICRITERIA >0, ML_CTIFOR is set to the average of the errors of the forces stored in a history. Note that ML_ICRITERIA =1 and ML_ICRITERIA =2, average over different data. In the first case the average is performed over errors after updates of the force fields, and in the second case over all recent error estimates (see ML_ICRITERIA ). In both cases, if ML_CTIFOR is updated, it is set to ML_CTIFOR = (average of the stored errors in the history) *(1.0 + ML_CX ). Obviously setting ML_CX to a positive value will result in fewer first principles calculations and fewer updates of the MLFF, whereas negative values result in more frequent first principles calculations (as well as updates of the MLFF). Typical values of ML_CX are between -0.2 and 0.0 for ML_ICRITERIA =1, and 0.0 and 0.3 for ML_ICRITERIA =2 (a good starting value is 0.2 for ML_ICRITERIA =2). For training runs using heating, the default usually results in very well balanced machine learned force fields. When the training is performed at a fixed temperature, it is often desirable to decrease to ML_CX =-0.1, in order to increase the number of first principle calculations and thus the size of the training set (the default can result in too few training data). The number of entries in the history are controlled by ML_MHIS for ML_ICRITERIA =1, and it is currently fixed to 400 for ML_ICRITERIA =2 (in future releases 50 x ML_MHIS ).

Therefore, by default LTBOUNDLIBXC =.FALSE. and Libxc should be compiled with the option --disable-fhc has explained here . Thus, the recommendation is to set LTBOUNDLIBXC =.TRUE. only in the case convergence shows an erratic behavior. If this choice is made, then the forces and stress tensor should be carefully monitored if a geometry optimization is done.

The recommended settings are IWAVPR >10. In this case, the prediction is performed without an external file TMPCAR (i.e. all required arrays are stored in the main memory). The following options are available for IWAVPR : IWAVPR =0 no extrapolation, usually not preferable for first-principles molecular dynamics simulations or relaxations of the ions into the groundstate. IWAVPR =1|11 Simple extrapolation of the charge density using atomic charge densities (eq. (9.8) in thesis G. Kresse). This switch is convenient for geometry optimizations (ionic relaxation and volume/cell shape with the conjugate gradient or Quasi-Newton methods, i.e. IBRION =1,2,3 etc.) IWAVPR =2|12 A second-order extrapolation for the orbitals and the charge density (eq.

It might cause instabilities during on-the-fly learning, so the default is 11 in this case.

LSINGLES enables the calculation of the singles contributions to the correlation energy that can be represented by the following Feynman (time-ordered) diagrams:   LSINGLES is used in combination with the low-scaling ACFDT/RPA and GW algorithms. If the ACFDT/RPA algorithm is selected with ALGO =RPAR|ACFDTR and LSINGLES is set, the code calculates two singles contributions and writes following lines to OUTCAR Here, renomalized HF singles corresponds to the renormalized singles contribution suggested by Ren and coworkers:  {\\displaystyle E^{rSE}_c = -\\sum_{a\\in virt, i\\in occ} \\frac{|\\langle i| V^{HF} - V_0^{KS}|a\\rangle|^2 }{\\epsilon_a-\\epsilon_i} } {\\displaystyle E^{rSE}_c = -\\sum_{a\\in virt, i\\in occ} \\frac{|\\langle i| V^{HF} - V_0^{KS}|a\\rangle|^2 }{\\epsilon_a-\\epsilon_i} } This contribution accounts for the change of the mean-field exchange energy and can be derived consistently within the AC-FDT framework as described in Sec. II D Eq. (28) of Klime\u0161 et al.

Specify a separate set of friction coefficient for the lattice degrees-of-freedom, using the LANGEVIN_GAMMA_L -tag. Set a mass for the lattice degrees-of-freedom, using the PMASS -tag. Optionally, one may define an external pressure (in kB), by means of the PSTRESS -tag. Note that the advanced simulation protocols, such metadynamics, or geometric constraints and restraints are available within the MDALGO =3 setting. Stochastic boundary conditions In some cases it is desirable to study approach of initially non-equilibrium system to equilibrium. Examples of such simulations include the impact problems when a particle with large kinetic energy hits a surface or calculation of friction force between two surfaces sliding with respect to each other. As shown by Toton et al.  , this type of problems can be studied using the stochastic boundary conditions (SBC) derived from the generalized Langevin equation by Kantorovich and Rompotis.  In this approach, the system of interest is divided into three regions: (a) fixed atoms, (b) the internal (Newtonian) atoms moving according to Newtonian dynamics, and (c) a buffer region of Langevin atoms ( i.e. , atoms governed by Langevin equations of motion ) located between (a) and (b). The role of the Langevin atoms is to dissipate heat, while the fixed atoms are needed solely to create the correct potential well for the Langevin atoms to move in. The Newtonian region should include all atoms relevant to the process under study: in the case of the impact problem, for instance, the Newtonian region should contain atoms of the molecule hitting the surface and several uppermost layers of the material forming the surface. Performing molecular dynamics with such a setup guarantees that the system (possibly out of equilibrium initially) arrives at the appropriate canonical distribution. To run a simulation with stochastic boundary conditions, one has to: Set the standard MD-related tags: IBRION =0, TEBEG , POTIM , and NSW Set ISIF =2 Set MDALGO =3 to invoke the Langevin thermostat Prepare the POSCAR file in such a way that the Newtonian and Langevin atoms are treated as different species (even if they are chemically identical). In your POSCAR , use \"selective dynamics\" and the corresponding logical flags to define the frozen and moveable atoms. Specify friction coefficients gamma, for all species in the POSCAR file, by means of the LANGEVIN_GAMMA -tag: set the friction coefficients to 0 for all fixed and Newtonian atoms, and choose a proper gamma for the Langevin atoms. Consider a system consisting of 16 hydrogen and 48 silicon atoms. Suppose that eight silicon atoms are considered to be Langevin atoms and the remaining 32 Si atoms are either fixed or Newtonian atoms.

    "description": "compute the hyperfine tensors at the atomic sites (available as of vasp.5.3.2). To have VASP compute the hyperfine tensors at the atomic sites, set The hyperfine tensor A I describes the interaction between a nuclear spin S I (located at site R I ) and the electronic spin distribution S e (in most cases associated with a paramagnetic defect state)  : In general it is written as the sum of an isotropic part, the so-called Fermi contact term, and an anisotropic (dipolar) part. The Fermi contact term is given by where rho s is the spin density, \u03bc 0 is the magnetic susceptibility of free space, gamma e the electron gyromagnetic ratio, gamma I the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus at R I , and {\\displaystyle \\langle S_z \\rangle} {\\displaystyle \\langle S_z \\rangle} the expectation value of the z -component of the total electronic spin. delta T ( r ) is a smeared out delta function, as described in the Appendix of Ref.  . The dipolar contributions to the hyperfine tensor are given by In the equations above r =| r |, r i the i-th component of r , and r is taken relative to the position of the nucleus R I . The nuclear gyromagnetic ratios should be specified by means of the NGYROMAG -tag: where one should specify one number for each of the N species on the POSCAR file, i.e. if C, H, N, and O are listed as species in the POSCAR file, then there should be four numbers in NGYROMAG , regardless of how many total atoms there are. Input An example INCAR is presented below used for a Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond: Change the values of NGYROMAG to your corresponding system. LASPH is commented out. For crystals, it is not generally important; however, for molecules, it is very important. Output As usual, all output is written to the OUTCAR file. VASP writes three blocks of data. The first is for the Fermi contact coupling parameter: with an entry for each ion on the POSCAR file. A pw , A 1PS , A 1AE , and A 1c are the plane wave, pseudo one-center, all-electron one-center, and one-center core contributions to the Fermi contact term, respectively. The total Fermi contact term is given by A tot . The dipolar contributions are listed next: Again one line per ion in the POSCAR file. The total hyperfine tensors are written as: i.e., the tensors have been diagonalized and rearranged. Units The Fermi contact term {\\displaystyle A} {\\displaystyle A} is measured in following units {\\displaystyle = \\left\\times \\left\\times \\left\\times \\left = \\frac{T^2m^3}{J}\\times \\frac{J}{T}\\times \\frac{MHz}{T}\\times \\frac{1}{m^3} = MHz } {\\displaystyle = \\left\\times \\left\\times \\left\\times \\left = \\frac{T^2m^3}{J}\\times \\frac{J}{T}\\times \\frac{MHz}{T}\\times \\frac{1}{m^3} = MHz } with {\\displaystyle \\mu_0=4\\pi\\times 10^{-7} T^2 m^3 J^{-1}} {\\displaystyle \\mu_0=4\\pi\\times 10^{-7} T^2 m^3 J^{-1}} , {\\displaystyle g_e\\mu_e=9.28476377\\times 10^{-24} J T^{-1}, |\\psi(0)|^2=10^{30}m^{-3}} {\\displaystyle g_e\\mu_e=9.28476377\\times 10^{-24} J T^{-1}, |\\psi(0)|^2=10^{30}m^{-3}} . NGYROMAG is given in units of MHz/T. Advice PAW pseudopotentials Choice of PAW potentials : The hyperfine coupling parameter can be sensitive to the specific PAW potential used, as different pseudopotentials include a varying number of electrons in the valence (i.e. _sv, _pv). It is important to match the all-electron (AE) wavefunction. GW pseudopotentials (i.e. _GW) often offer a better description than standard potentials. Core contributions and hybrid functionals Make sure to include core contributions when reporting Fermi contact terms  . These are very important and their inclusion improves comparison to experiment  . The use of hybrid functionals can also improve the hyperfine coupling constants when compared to experiment. E.g., for defects in silicon, HSE06 localizes the defect relative to PBE, significantly improving the description  . Input parameters We recommend using tightly converged settings: Additionally, we recommend performing convergence tests with respect to the plane-wave energy cutoff ENCUT and k-point mesh KPOINTS to ensure convergence has been achieved for your system. Convergence is generally quick with respect to energy cutoff. Convergence can be very dependent on k-point mesh density. In some cases, e.g. if your cell is too small, then increasing the k-point mesh can result in convergence to a non-magnetic solution, eliminating the hyperfine coupling. Test your system with LASPH = .TRUE. and .FALSE. In some cases, non-spherical contributions may be important. Converging to non-magnetic states It is possible that your system relaxes to a non-magnetic solution, causing the hyperfine splitting to disappear (i.e. all zeros). If you think your system should be magnetic, you can enforce it using NUPDOWN , which will return the hyperfine splitting, cf. forum post: https://vasp.at/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16921 . NUPDOWN will change the Total magnetic moment S= at the start of the hyperfine coupling section in the OUTCAR . Related tags and articles NGYROMAG Examples that use this tag References"

  "EFOR": {

    "description": "EFOR sets external forces in eV/ \u212b on each atom in the cartesian x-, y-, and z-directions. The order of the ions is equivalent to the order in the POSCAR file, and for each ion, x-, y-, and z-components have to be given. The array of external forces will be added to the forces computed internally for each ionic step ( ionic minimization or molecular dynamics ). If an ionic minimization is performed with non-zero external forces, the converged structures will be only at a minimum accounting for the constraint of the external forces. Regardless of whether the convergence criterion is set to minimize total forces, or converge the total energy. While the total sum of all external forces in all directions must be zero, it is possible to achieve this by putting balancing forces on an ion that is fixed by the selective dynamics feature in the POSCAR file. Format EFOR can be a very long array, as 3 values need to be set for each ion in the system. The format is equivalent to setting the magnetic moments in the noncollinear case using MAGMOM , so it is possible to use an N*F syntax to indicate that the next N entries in the array should be of value F . E.g.: In this example, we have 64 ions, so we have to set 3*64=192 values in the array. Only the cartesian z components of the first and last ion should be non-zero, which enables a compact INCAR line. If more force components are non-zero, readability is increased by utilizing the multi-line option in the INCAR file. This is achieved by using backslashes ( \\ ) to negate line breaks or put the multi-line expression in quotes ( \" ). E.g. for a 32 atom system with forces in the x- and z-directions on the first and last 8 atoms: Symmetry and periodic boundary conditions Symmetry considerations Setting external forces will, in most cases, break some symmetries of the system, resulting in more irreducible k points and thus increased computational effort. If any non-zero external forces are set, the symmetry reduction is reported in the OUTCAR after all other symmetry operations. E.g.: Periodic boundary conditions All VASP calculations are performed under periodic boundary conditions. When external forces are applied to bulk systems, this can lead to unexpected results. E.g. pushing an atom towards another atom in the same unit cell might pull it further away from the same atom in a neighboring unit cell. Thus external forces cannot be used to uniformly compress or strain a bulk system along a specific axis. This can however be achieved by lengthening or shortening the relevant lattice vector. On the other hand, external forces should be used if strain needs to be applied to a slab, a molecule, or any other system in which a vacuum region is used. When e.g. a surface slab needs to be compressed in the direction normal to the surface plane, the lattice vector cannot be shortened because this would collapse the vacuum. External forces on the atoms at the surfaces can achieve the desired effect. External forces during on-the-fly learning External forces can be used during on-the-fly training for machine-learned force fields . In that case, the external forces will be only used during the ionic updates but will be removed for the training. This ensures that only forces arising from interatomic interactions will contribute to the force field and the resulting force field can be used without, or with different external forces. Output The external forces are printed to the OUTCAR file after the positions of ions. E.g.: After each ionic step, the external forces are included in the reported TOTAL-FORCE array, but not separately listed, since they are not updated during a VASP run.: Example As an example, the compression of an Al(001) slab under 4 GPa of pressure is chosen. At ~39500 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level, this is considerable, but pressures in diamond anvil cells can be two orders of magnitude larger. The four-layer thick slab corresponding to the following POSCAR is already relaxed without external forces: The pressure has to be converted into the correct units. Forces in VASP are given in eV/ \u212b , and an area in \u212b 2 , thus GPa needs to be converted to (eV/ \u212b )/ \u212b 2 , or eV \u212b -3 : With a lattice parameter of 4.047 \u212b , the surface area A of the slab is about 16.381 \u212b 2 . Thus the total force in eV/ \u212b we have to put on the top layer to compress the slab with 4 GPa of pressure is: or 0.20448 eV/ \u212b per surface atom. The INCAR file can now be written: Note that the forces on the top atoms are balanced by putting the opposing force on one atom only. This is feasible since both atoms in the bottom layer are fixed by selective dynamics flags. Using a 5x5x1 \u0393-centered mesh in the KPOINTS file, and the standard PBE Al POTCAR , the calculation converges in less than 10 ionic steps. The slab is compressed by less than 2%, from 6.21 \u212b to 6.10 \u212b . This relatively small compression at relatively high pressure is due to three factors: 4 GPa corresponds to forces of ~0.2 eV/ \u212b , which is only 20 times the negligible force limit of 0.01 eV/ \u212b in this calculation. We do not allow the material to expand in the direction normal to the pressure by keeping the cell shape fixed with ISIF = 2. Intra-atomic forces in perfect close-packed metallic crystals are powerful, and lattice imperfections usually mediate deformations in real materials. For layered materials, molecules on surfaces, and other, less strongly-bound systems, similar forces will have larger effects, however. Related Tags and Sections ICONST Examples that use this tag"

    "description": "VCA is short for the virtual crystal approximation; the tag allows to \"weight\" each species found in the POTCAR file. The tag VCA must be supplied for each atom type or species found in the POTCAR and POSCAR file, respectively. It weights the corresponding POTCAR files according to the values given in the INCAR file, with the default being 1. For instance, the formal valency found in the POTCAR files is multiplied by the supplied values. Likewise, the local potential, the augmentation charges, and the non-local pseudopotential strength parameters are scaled by the supplied values. It is possible to use this flag to perform calculations in the framework of the virtual crystal approximation. Say you want to simulate Sn doping in a Ge lattice. This can be achieved using a POTCAR file with a Ge and Sn data set and the following POSCAR file: If VCA is set to the Ge atoms are weighted with a weight of 0.99, whereas the Sn atoms are weighted by 0.01 (see  for an example application). The implementation in VASP closely follows the methodology suggested by Bellaiche and Vanderbilt  . Caveats: Unfortunately, results of this kind of VCA calculations are often not very reliable. The problems are even apparent in the original publications  . The key point is that the used PAW potentials need to be constructed so that the pseudo atomic waves are very similar for the potentials that are \"mixed\" (in the example above, this would be the Ge and Sn potentials). This can be achieved by carefully optimizing the radial cutoffs. Furthermore, the local potentials of the two POTCAR files need to be very similar. This means that results for many standard potentials are not accurate. For instance, Vegard's law is often not even approximately observed (instead, the volume is too large at 50 % mixing). The problem is particularly severe if semi-core states are treated as valence states. For instance, for the Ge and Sn alloy, the d electrons had to be treated as core electrons to obtain reasonable results. Any attempts to treat the d electrons as valence states lead to grossly incorrect results.

    "description": "ML_MB_MIN sets the minimum number of local reference configurations required for generation of a machine-learned force field. Machine-learned force fields based on the kernel method require a reasonable amount of reference atomic environments in order to provide meaningful predictions. Typically, the on-the-fly algorithm in VASP collects these local reference configurations (also called kernel basis functions) during an MD simulation ( ML_MODE = train ). However, at the start of the trajectory usually only very few local reference configurations are available. How many depends on the system size, symmetry and number of atoms (per type). This tag controls how many local reference configurations are required for each atom type before training of a force field is allowed. Setting a higher value may yield a more robust initial force field at the cost of more ab initio calculations during the first few MD steps. If a training is scheduled in the current step, i.e., the STATUS line in the ML_LOGFILE shows learning or critical , but not enough atomic environments were collected, a text message will be emitted in the MSG line. Here is an example: Here, in the first two steps the ML_MB_MIN threshold prevents training of an MLFF, even if the Bayesian error estimation signals a critical step. The force field is then only generated in the third step, after the minimum number of three local reference configurations have been collected.

MB_AB = greatest number of local reference configurations within all species in the ML_AB file. The default value for ML_MODE = train and ML_MODE = select is a relatively safe value for most materials. However one might need to increase it to a greater value for liquids, polymers and amorphous systems, or when a MLFF for many different polytypes is trained. By default ( ML_LBASIS_DISCARD = .TRUE. ), if the number of local reference configurations would exceed ML_MB , VASP would continue the calculation and disposes of these, but one should make extensive tests whether the generated MLFF is sufficiently accurate. If VASP stops, subsequent training can be restarted from the existing ML_AB file. This avoids loss of already acquired training data. Depending on the calculation mode VASP adds a little overhead in the allocation of ML_MB arrays to buffer for new candidate structures. Here are the buffer sizes for each mode: ML_MODE = train : No ML_AB present (learning from scratch): min( NSW , ML_MCONF_NEW ) * MAXAT_SP ML_AB present (continuation of learning): min( NSW , ML_MCONF_NEW ) * MAXAT_SP ML_MODE = select : ML_MCONF_NEW * MAXAT_SP ML_MODE = refit : MAXAT_SP ML_MODE = refitbayesian : MAXAT_SP ML_MODE = run : 0 The flag ML_MB also determines the maximum number of rows of the design matrix.

The design matrix is allocated statically at the beginning of the run, since several parts of the code use MPI shared memory and dynamic reallocation of these arrays can cause issues on many operating systems. An estimate of the size of the design matrix and all other large arrays is printed out to the ML_LOGFILE before allocation. The design matrix is fully distributed in a block-cyclic fashion for scaLAPACK, and thus the memory requirement for each core scales inversely proportional to the number of used cores.

When starting from atomic charge densities ( ICHARG =2), VASP will try to do this automatically by setting MAGMOM to NUPDOWN / NIONS . The user can of course overwrite this default by specifying a different MAGMOM (which should still result in the correct total moment). If one initializes the charge density from the one-electron wavefunctions, the initial moment is always correct, because VASP \"pushes\" the required number of electrons from the down to the up component. Initializing the charge density from the CHGCAR file ( ICHARG =1), however, the initial moment is usually incorrect! If no value is set (or NUPDOWN =-1) a full relaxation will be performed.

    "description": "The LEFG computes the electric field gradient (EFG) at positions of the atomic nuclei. For LEFG =.TRUE., the electric field gradient tensors at the positions of the atomic nuclei are calculated using the method of Petrilli et al.  . The EFG tensors are symmetric. The principal components V ii and asymmetry parameter \u03b7 are printed for each atom. Following convention the principal components V ii are ordered such that: The asymmetry parameter is defined as {\\displaystyle \\eta = {(V_{yy} - V_{xx})}/ V_{zz}} {\\displaystyle \\eta = {(V_{yy} - V_{xx})}/ V_{zz}} . For so-called \"quadrupolar nuclei\", i.e. , nuclei with nuclear spin I>1/2, NMR experiments can access V zz and \u03b7. To convert the V zz values into the C q often encountered in NMR literature, one has to specify the nuclear quadrupole moment by means of the QUAD_EFG -tag. Recommendations and advice Tight settings are required for calculating the electric field gradient. Input parameters A larger ENCUT value than usual, generally much higher than the value given by ENMAX in the POTCAR file, e.g. 800 eV for C in diamond, rather than the standard 400 eV. A small EDIFF is required to provide converged chemical shifts, e.g. 1E-8 eV. Tighter precision, e.g. PREC = Accurate. Non-spherical contributions to the gradient of the density inside PAW spheres, i.e. LASPH = .TRUE. Structure The structure is extremely important, so using the experimental structure can improve results. Differences of 25 mAngstrom in structure can make a difference of 40 % to {\\displaystyle V_{zz}} {\\displaystyle V_{zz}}  . PAW pseudopotentials The use of PAW potentials has a strong influence, GW POTCAR files often improve values. Semi-core electrons can be important (check the POSCAR files with *_pv or *_sv ) as well as explicit inclusion of augmentation channels with {\\displaystyle d} {\\displaystyle d} -projectors.

    "description": "NCORE determines the number of compute cores that work on an individual orbital (available as of VASP.5.2.13). VASP currently offers parallelization and data distribution over bands and/or over plane wave coefficients, and as of VASP.5.3.2, parallelization over k -points (no data distribution, see KPAR ). To achieve high efficiency on massively parallel systems or modern multi-core machines, it is strongly recommended to use all parallelization options available. Most algorithms work with any data distribution (except for the single band conjugated gradient, which is obsolete). NCORE is available from VASP.5.2.13 on, and is more handy than the previous parameter NPAR . The user should either specify NCORE or NPAR , where NPAR takes a higher preference. The relation between both parameters is NCORE =number-of-cores /KPAR / NPAR NCORE determines how many cores share the work on an individual orbital. The current default is NCORE =1, meaning that one orbital is treated by one core. NPAR is then set to the total number of cores (divided by KPAR). If NCORE equals the total number of cores, NPAR is set to 1. This implies data distribution over plane wave coefficients only: all cores will work together on every individual band, i.e., the plane wave coefficients of each band are distributed over all cores. This is usually very slow and should be avoided. NCORE =1 is the optimal setting for small unit cells, and platforms with a small communication bandwidth. It is also a good choice for up to 8 cores. However, this mode substantially increases the memory requirements, because the non-local projector functions must be stored entirely on each core. In addition, substantial all-to-all communications are required to orthogonalize the bands. On massively parallel systems and modern multi-core machines we strongly recommend to set For large unit cells, we found that this can improve the performance by up to a factor four compared to the default, and it also significantly improves the stability of the code due to reduced memory requirements. Ideally, NCORE should be a factor of the number-of-cores-per-socket (or number-of-cores-per-node), since this reduces communication between the sockets or nodes. The best value NCORE depends somewhat on the number of atoms in the unit cell. Values around 4 are usually ideal for 100 atoms in the unit cell. For very large unit cells (more than 400 atoms) values around 12-16 are often optimal. If you run extensive simulations for similar systems, make your own tests. Finally, the optimal settings for NCORE and LPLANE depend strongly on the type of machine you are using. Some recommended setups: LINUX cluster linked by Infiniband, modern multicore machines: LINUX cluster linked by 1 Gbit Ethernet, and LINUX clusters with single cores: Massively parallel machines with dedicated network (maybe Cray): Related tags and articles NPAR , LPLANE , LSCALU , NSIM , KPAR , LSCALAPACK , LSCAAWARE , OpenACC GPU Port of VASP , Combining MPI and OpenMP Examples that use this tag"

If VOSKOWN is set to 1, the interpolation formula according to Vosko, Wilk and Nusair  is used (this interpolation is based on the RPA correlation energy of partially spin polarized systems). The Vosko, Wilk and Nusair interpolation usually enhances the magnetic moments and the magnetic energies. Because the Vosko-Wilk-Nusair interpolation is the interpolation usually applied in the context of gradient corrected functionals, it is desirable to use this interpolation whenever the PW91 functional is applied. Setting this tag is not required for most modern functions, such as the PBE or PBEsol functional, since these functional strictly follow the original publications and disregard the setting of this flag entirely (this implicitly implies that the correlation energy is interpolated according to Vosko, Wilk and Nusair).
