KPOINTS_OPT_NKBATCH =  Default: KPOINTS_OPT_NKBATCH = Number of k-points in the irreducible Brillouin zone of the self-consistent calculation. Description: KPOINTS_OPT_NKBATCH determines the size of the batch of k-points for the KPOINTS_OPT driver. When the KPOINTS_OPT is present an additional non-self-consistent calculation is performed after self-consistency is reached. This one-shot calculation is done in batches of N k-points to reduce memory usage. Increasing the size of the batch leads to faster calculation times but higher memory usage in the non-self-consistent calculation.
