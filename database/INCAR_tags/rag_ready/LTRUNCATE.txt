KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LTRUNCATE = .True. | .False. Default: KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LTRUNCATE = .False. Description: KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LTRUNCATE truncates the coulomb kernel to remove electrostatic interactions along non-periodic dimensions Setting KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LTRUNCATE = T switches on coulomb kernel truncation methods. These methods removes interactions with periodic replicas in non-periodic directions, i.e. along the surface normal for 2D materials and along all directions for 0D systems such as atoms and molecules. Default settings The following default settings are assumed when setting KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LTRUNCATE = T, which translates to 0D coulomb truncation which is suitable for a molecule using the coarsen before pad strategy  .
