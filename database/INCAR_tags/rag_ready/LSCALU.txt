LSCALU =  Default: LSCALU = .FALSE. Description: LSCALU switches on the parallel LU decomposition (using scaLAPACK) in the orthonormalization of the wave functions. For LSCALU =.TRUE. the LU decomposition in the orthormalization of the wave functions is done in parallel, using scaLAPACK routines. Provided, of course, LSCALAPACK =.TRUE. and VASP was compiled with scaLAPACK support ( precompiler flag : -DscaLAPACK). In many cases, the scaLAPACK LU decomposition based is slower than the serial LU decomposition (compare the timing ORTHCH in the respective OUTCAR files). Hence the default is LSCALU =.FALSE. (subspace rotations, however, are still done using scaLAPACK). Related tags and articles NPAR , NCORE , LPLANE , NSIM , KPAR , LSCALAPACK , LSCAAWARE Examples that use this tag
