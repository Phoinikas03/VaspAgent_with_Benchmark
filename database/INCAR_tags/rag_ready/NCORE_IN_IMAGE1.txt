NCORE_IN_IMAGE1 =  Default: NCORE_IN_IMAGE1 = 0 Description: This tag specifies the number of cores in the first image. This tag works for two images, specifically, if VCAIMAGES is set (this also sets IMAGES =2). VCAIMAGES splits the available cores into two groups both working independently in the subdirectories 01 and 02. The tag NCORE_IN_IMAGE1 defines how many of cores are used for the first image (01). The remainder of the cores is used for the second image (working in the subdirectory 02). Related tags and articles VCAIMAGES , IMAGES , SCALEE
