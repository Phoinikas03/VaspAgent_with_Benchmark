POTIM =  Description: POTIM sets the time step in molecular dynamics or the step width in ionic relaxations. For IBRION = 0, POTIM gives the time step (in fs) in all ab-initio Molecular Dynamics runs, it has to be supplied therefore, otherwise VASP crashes immediately after having started. For IBRION =1, 2, and 3, which corresponds to ionic relaxation using a quasi-Newton algorithm, conjugate-gradient algorithm, and damped molecular dynamics, respectively, the POTIM tag serves as a scaling constant for the step widths. The quasi-Newton algorithm is especially sensitive to the choice of this parameter. For IBRION = 5, and 6, a phonon calculations using the finite differences approach is done, where POTIM is the width of the displacement of each ion to calculate the Hessian Matrix.
