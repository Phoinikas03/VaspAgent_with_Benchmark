LPARD =  Default: LPARD = .FALSE. Description: Determines whether partial (band and/or k -point-decomposed) charge densities are evaluated. An LPARD run is a postprocessing step that requires a pre-converged calculation. It writes the partial density, or multiple partial charge densities, to one PARCHG file or several PARCHG.*.* files, depending on the setting of LSEPB and LSEPK . If LPARDH5 = .TRUE., the output is redirected from PARCHG to vaspout.h5 . There are various ways to divide the partial charge density. You can pick the contributing bands either by index (refer to NBMOD and IBAND ) or by energy range (refer to EINT ), and select contributing k points through KPUSE .
