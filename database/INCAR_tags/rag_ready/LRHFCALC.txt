LRHFCALC = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LRHFCALC = .FALSE. Description: Switch on the decomposition of the exchange functional for the range-separated hybrid RSHXLDA or RSHXPBE functionals . If LRHFCALC =.TRUE. the exchange functional is decomposed into short-range LDA (or PBE) and long-range Hartree-Fock for calculations with the range-separated hybrid RSHXLDA or RSHXPBE functionals.    The screening parameter is specified by means of the HFSCREEN tag. The setting of the RSHXLDA and RSHXPBE functionals is shown on the page listing the hybrid functionals .
