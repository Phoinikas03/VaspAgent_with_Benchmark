ISIF = 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 Description: Determines if the stress tensor is calculated and which ionic degrees of freedom are varied. For ISIF {\displaystyle \ge} {\displaystyle \ge} 2, the stress tensor is calculated. It is defined as the negative of the derivative of the energy {\displaystyle E } {\displaystyle E } with respect to the strain tensor {\displaystyle \eta_{ji}} {\displaystyle \eta_{ji}} : This might be different from other first principles codes. A positive in the diagonals means that the system is under compressive strain and wants to expand. A negative value implies that the system is under tensile strain and wants to reduce its volume. The stress tensor is symmetric {\displaystyle \sigma_{ij}=\sigma_{ji}} {\displaystyle \sigma_{ij}=\sigma_{ji}} , and, thus, it has six independent entries. The calculation of the stress tensor is relatively time-consuming, and, therefore, by default, it is switched off in some cases. The forces are always calculated. ISIF also determines which degrees of freedom (ionic positions, cell volume, and cell shape) of the structure are allowed to change. For ISIF = 1 , only the trace of the stress tensor is calculated. This means only the total pressure is correct and can be read off in the line: Accuracy To further control the ionic degrees of freedom that can vary during the calculation, set `Selective dynamics` in the POSCAR file. ISIF = 8 is only available as of VASP.6.4.1.
