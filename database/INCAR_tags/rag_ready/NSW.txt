NSW =  Default: NSW = 0 Description: NSW sets the maximum number of ionic steps. IBRION = 0: IBRION != 0: Within each ionic step at most NELM electronic steps are performed. It is fewer if the convergence criterium set by EDIFF is met before. Forces and stresses are calculated according to the setting of ISIF for each ionic step.
