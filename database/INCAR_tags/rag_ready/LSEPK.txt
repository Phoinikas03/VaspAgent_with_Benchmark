LSEPK =  Default: LSEPK = .FALSE. Description: Specifies whether the partial charge density is summed up for all selected k points or separated and printed out in different files. If LPARD = .TRUE. the partial charge density is calculated for a subset of bands and k points depending on the setting of the tags IBAND , KPUSE , NBMOD , and EINT . If LSEPK is set to .TRUE., separate PARCHG.ALLB.nk or PARCHG.nb.nk files are created, dependent on the LSEPB tag. If LSEPK = .FALSE., the output is written to PARCHG or PARCHG.nb.ALLK, again depending on LSEPB . Here are four examples to illustrate the interplay of LSEPB and LSEPK . in all cases, the following settings apply, selecting three specific bands and two k points IBAND = 9 10 11 , NBMOD = 3 , and KPUSE = 1 34 : LSEPB = .FALSE. , LSEPK = .FALSE. LSEPB = .TRUE. , LSEPK = .FALSE. LSEPB = .FALSE. , LSEPK = .TRUE. LSEPB = .TRUE. , LSEPK = .TRUE.
