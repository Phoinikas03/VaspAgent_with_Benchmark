RANDOM_SEED =  Default: RANDOM_SEED = based on the system clock Description: RANDOM_SEED specifies the seed of the random-number generator (compile VASP with -Dtbdyn ). The random-number generator (RNG) generates a sequence of random numbers, which is initialized by the tag RANDOM_SEED . For example, in molecular dynamics simulations, the RNG can be used to initialize atomic velocities. Hence, the seed for the RNG influences the trajectory of a molecular dynamics simulation. The three integers of RANDOM_SEED must fulfill these conditions: A typical input for the RANDOM_SEED looks like this: The initial value of RANDOM_SEED and the value after each MD step are written to the REPORT file.
