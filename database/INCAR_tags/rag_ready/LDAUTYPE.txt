LDAUTYPE = 1 | 2 | 4 Default: LDAUTYPE = 2 Description: LDAUTYPE specifies the DFT+U variant that will be used. The following variants of the DFT+U are available: LDAUTYPE =1: The rotationally invariant DFT+U introduced by Liechtenstein et al.  LDAUTYPE =2: The simplified (rotationally invariant) approach to DFT+U, introduced by Dudarev et al.  LDAUTYPE =3: Linear response ansatz of Cococcioni et al.  to compute U. See how to calculate U . LDAUTYPE =4: Same as LDAUTYPE =1, but without exchange splitting. A method to estimate the parameters for DFT+U is the constrained-random-phase approximation . Another method is the linear response ansatz with LDAUTYPE =3, mentioned above. On the other hand, in many applications, the DFT+U parameters are used as tuning parameters to fit experimental data. This is because the CHGCAR file contains only information up to angular momentum quantum number set by LMAXMIX for the on-site PAW occupancy matrices . When the CHGCAR file is read and kept fixed in the course of the calculations ( ICHARG =11), the results will necessarily not be identical to a self-consistent run. The deviations are often large for DFT+U calculations. It is possible to use LDAUTYPE =1, 2, and 3 for a non–spin-polarized calculation with ISPIN =1.
