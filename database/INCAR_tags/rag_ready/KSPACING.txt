KSPACING =  Default: KSPACING = 0.5 Description: The tag KSPACING determines the number of k points if the KPOINTS file is not present. KSPACING is the smallest allowed spacing between k points in units of {\displaystyle \AA^{-1}} {\displaystyle \AA^{-1}} . The number of k points increases when the spacing is decreased. The number of k points in the direction of the first, second and third reciprocal lattice vector is determined by {\displaystyle N_i= \mathrm{max}(1, \mathrm{ceiling}( | \mathbf{b}_i| 2\pi / \mathrm{KSPACING} ))} {\displaystyle N_i= \mathrm{max}(1, \mathrm{ceiling}( | \mathbf{b}_i| 2\pi / \mathrm{KSPACING} ))} with {\displaystyle \mathrm{ceiling}( x )} {\displaystyle \mathrm{ceiling}( x )} being the ceiling function which returns the least integer that is equal or larger than {\displaystyle x} {\displaystyle x} . In this equation, {\displaystyle \mathbf{b}_i } {\displaystyle \mathbf{b}_i } are the reciprocal lattice vectors {\displaystyle \mathbf{b}_i \mathbf{a}_j = \delta_{ij} } {\displaystyle \mathbf{b}_i \mathbf{a}_j = \delta_{ij} } . The generated grid is centered at the {\displaystyle \Gamma} {\displaystyle \Gamma} point if KGAMMA =True (default), i.e., includes the {\displaystyle \Gamma} {\displaystyle \Gamma} point. For KGAMMA =False, the grid is shifted away from the {\displaystyle \Gamma} {\displaystyle \Gamma} point as done for Monkhorst-Pack grids. If the k points are generated using the automatic mode in the KPOINTS file, {\displaystyle N_i} {\displaystyle N_i} is calculated as {\displaystyle N_i= \mathrm{int}(\mathrm{max}(1, R_k| \mathbf{b}_i| + 0.5)) } {\displaystyle N_i= \mathrm{int}(\mathrm{max}(1, R_k| \mathbf{b}_i| + 0.5)) } with {\displaystyle R_k=2\pi/\mathrm{KSPACING}} {\displaystyle R_k=2\pi/\mathrm{KSPACING}} and rounding it to the nearest integer. We recommend using the KSPACING tag in the INCAR file and avoiding the automatic mode via the KPOINTS file. Related tags and articles KGAMMA , KPOINTS Examples that use this tag
