LNMR_SYM_RED = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LNMR_SYM_RED = .FALSE. Description: discard symmetry operations that are not consistent with the way k -space derivatives are calculated in the linear-response calculations of chemical shifts. The star on which the k -space derivative is calculated is oriented along the cartesian directions in k space. If the symmetry operations in k space do not map this star onto itself, erroneous results can be obtained. To check for such operations, set LNMR_SYM_RED =.TRUE.. VASP then disregards such operations and the resulting first Brillouin zone (IBZ) is larger. In case of any doubt set LNMR_SYM_RED =.TRUE. It determines the orientation of the k -space star and, hence, can affect the efficiency via the number of k -points in the IBZ.
