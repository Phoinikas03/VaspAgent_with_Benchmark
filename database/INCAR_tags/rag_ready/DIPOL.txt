DIPOL =  Description: specifies the center of the cell in direct lattice coordinates with respect to which the total dipole-moment in the cell is calculated. The center of the cell w.r.t. which the total dipole-moment in the cell is calculated is specified as where R x , R y and R z are given in direct lattice coordinates. Calculations using the dipole correction, i.e. using tags IDIPOL or LDIPOL , require a definition of the center of the cell. Results of the computed dipole moment might differ for different positions. The reason for this difference is that the definition of the dipole 'destroys' the translational symmetry, i.e., the dipole is defined as This measure will provide consistent values only if {\displaystyle \rho_{\rm ions+valence}} {\displaystyle \rho_{\rm ions+valence}} drops to zero at some distance from {\displaystyle \mathbf R_{\rm center}} {\displaystyle \mathbf R_{\rm center}} . If this is not the case, the values are extremely sensitive with respect to changes in {\displaystyle \mathbf R_{\rm center}} {\displaystyle \mathbf R_{\rm center}} . In such cases, it might be beneficial to increase the size of the cell along the vacuum dimension (for surfaces) or for the entire cell (for isolated molecules). For practical purposes this means that for slab calculations or surfaces the position specified by DIPOL should roughly correspond to the center of mass of the atoms in the cell, so that there is enough vacuum for the field to dissipate.
