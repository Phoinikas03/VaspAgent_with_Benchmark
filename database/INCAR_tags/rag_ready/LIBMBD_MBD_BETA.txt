LIBMBD_MBD_BETA =  Default: LIBMBD_MBD_BETA = value that was determined for the exchange-correlation functional set with LIBMBD_XC Description: LIBMBD_MBD_BETA sets the value of the scaling factor {\displaystyle \beta} {\displaystyle \beta} (usually denoted {\displaystyle s_R} {\displaystyle s_R} ) in the many-body methods as implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . LIBMBD_MBD_BETA allows to choose the value of the damping parameter {\displaystyle \beta} {\displaystyle \beta} in the many-body methods as implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . The value is internally passed to the libMBD input mbd_beta described at the page  . LIBMBD_MBD_BETA is the same as the VDW_SR tag that is used for the VASP implementation of the many-body methods. libMBD is a separate library package that has to be downloaded  and compiled before VASP is compiled with the corresponding precompiler options and links to the libraries .
