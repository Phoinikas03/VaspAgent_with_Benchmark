PHON_NSTRUCT =  Default: PHON_NSTRUCT = none Description: This flag sets the number of structures for electron-phonon interactions from Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. This feature is only available from VASP version 6.0 or higher. For PHON_NSTRUCT =-1 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamic matrix are written to the file DYNMATFULL . For PHON_NSTRUCT =0 the ZG configuration  (one-shot) method is executed. For PHON_NSTRUCT >0 that many MC structures are prepared.
