LIBMBD_VDW_PARAMS_KIND = ts | tssurf Default: LIBMBD_VDW_PARAMS_KIND =ts (default in libMBD) Description: LIBMBD_VDW_PARAMS_KIND sets the type of free-atom van der Waals parameters that are used for the methods implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . LIBMBD_VDW_PARAMS_KIND allows to choose the set of van der Waals parameters from either the original Tkatchenko-Scheffler method  ( LIBMBD_VDW_PARAMS_KIND =ts) or its variant that was designed to be more accurate for systems with surface  ( LIBMBD_VDW_PARAMS_KIND =tssurf). The value is internally passed to the libMBD input vdw_params_kind described at the page  . LIBMBD_VDW_PARAMS_KIND is similar to the LTSSURF tag that is used for the VASP implementation of the Tkatchenko-Scheffler method. libMBD is a separate library package that has to be downloaded  and compiled before VASP is compiled with the corresponding precompiler options and links to the libraries .
