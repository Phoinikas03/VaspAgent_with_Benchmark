LIBMBD_C6AU =  Description: LIBMBD_C6AU defines the free-atom {\displaystyle C_6} {\displaystyle C_6} parameters ( {\displaystyle \mathrm{Hartree}} {\displaystyle \mathrm{Hartree}} {\displaystyle \mathrm{bohr}^{6}} {\displaystyle \mathrm{bohr}^{6}} ) used in the Tkatchenko-Scheffler and Many-body dispersion energy methods as implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . LIBMBD_C6AU allows to set values for the free-atom {\displaystyle C_6} {\displaystyle C_6} parameters ( {\displaystyle \mathrm{Hartree}} {\displaystyle \mathrm{Hartree}} {\displaystyle \mathrm{bohr}^{6}} {\displaystyle \mathrm{bohr}^{6}} ) used in the Tkatchenko-Scheffler and Many-body dispersion energy methods as implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . For each atom listed in the POSCAR file, a value has to be provided. The values are internally passed to the second column of the libMBD input free_values described at the page  . libMBD is a separate library package that has to be downloaded  and compiled before VASP is compiled with the corresponding precompiler options and links to the libraries .
