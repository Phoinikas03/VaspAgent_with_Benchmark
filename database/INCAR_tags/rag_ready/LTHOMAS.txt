LTHOMAS = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LTHOMAS = .FALSE. Description: LTHOMAS selects a decomposition of the exchange functional based on Thomas-Fermi exponential screening. If LTHOMAS =.TRUE. the decomposition of the exchange operator (in a range-separated hybrid functional ) into a short range and a long range part will be based on Thomas-Fermi exponential screening. The Thomas-Fermi screening length k TF is specified by means of the HFSCREEN tag. For typical semiconductors, a Thomas-Fermi screening length of about 1.8 Angstrom -1 yields reasonable band gaps. In principle, however, the Thomas-Fermi screening length depends on the valence electron density; VASP determines this parameter from the number of valence electrons (read from the POTCAR file) and the volume and writes the corresponding value to the OUTCAR file: Since, VASP counts the semi-core states and d -states as valence electrons, although these states do not contribute to the screening, the values reported by VASP are often incorrect.
