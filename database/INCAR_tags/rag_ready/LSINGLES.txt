LSINGLES = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LSINGLES = .FALSE. Description: Switch on singles contribution to correlation energy for GW algorithms .  LSINGLES enables the calculation of the singles contributions to the correlation energy that can be represented by the following Feynman (time-ordered) diagrams:   LSINGLES is used in combination with the low-scaling ACFDT/RPA and GW algorithms. If the ACFDT/RPA algorithm is selected with ALGO =RPAR|ACFDTR and LSINGLES is set, the code calculates two singles contributions and writes following lines to OUTCAR Here, renomalized HF singles corresponds to the renormalized singles contribution suggested by Ren and coworkers:  {\displaystyle E^{rSE}_c = -\sum_{a\in virt, i\in occ} \frac{|\langle i| V^{HF} - V_0^{KS}|a\rangle|^2 }{\epsilon_a-\epsilon_i} } {\displaystyle E^{rSE}_c = -\sum_{a\in virt, i\in occ} \frac{|\langle i| V^{HF} - V_0^{KS}|a\rangle|^2 }{\epsilon_a-\epsilon_i} } This contribution accounts for the change of the mean-field exchange energy and can be derived consistently within the AC-FDT framework as described in Sec. II D Eq. (28) of Klimeš et al.  In contrast, the HF single shot energy change line contains the somewhat simpler contribution  {\displaystyle E_c^{rSE} = \mathrm{Tr}\left, } {\displaystyle E_c^{rSE} = \mathrm{Tr}\left, } where {\displaystyle \gamma_{HF}} {\displaystyle \gamma_{HF}} is the Hartree-Fock density matrix, determined for the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian {\displaystyle \hat h_{HF}} {\displaystyle \hat h_{HF}} and {\displaystyle \gamma_{DFT}} {\displaystyle \gamma_{DFT}} is the Kohn-Sham density matrix. In all practical calculations, we found that both values, the single-shot HF and renormalized singles contributions, are exceedingly close to each other. If the GW algorithm is selected with ALGO =G0W0R, the OUTCAR contains also the singles contribution beyond the Hartree-Fock level {\displaystyle E_c^{GWSE} = \mathrm{Tr}\left, } {\displaystyle E_c^{GWSE} = \mathrm{Tr}\left, } where {\displaystyle \gamma_{RPA}} {\displaystyle \gamma_{RPA}} is the RPA density matrix.  For versions <= 6.4.2, this contribution is not directly printed to file. However, the first and second term is printed to OUTCAR : Version >6.4.2 writes the GWSE singles contribution to OUTCAR : The ACFDT total energy in the limit of infinite energy cutoff is then obtained by adding the singles contribution to the value of HF+E_corr(extrapolated) = -153.98810072 eV Related tags and articles NATURALO natural orbital selection for RPA and GW calculations ALGO for response functions and RPA calculations for an overview on total energies using the ACFDT/RPA formalism for a practical guide to GW calculations Basis set convergence of ACFDT/RPA calculations References
