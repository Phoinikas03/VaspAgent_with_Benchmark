LBLUEOUT = .TRUE.|.FALSE. Default: LBLUEOUT = .FALSE. Description: for LBLUEOUT =.TRUE., VASP writes output for the free-energy gradient calculation to the REPORT file (in case VASP was compiled with -Dtbdyn ). If LBLUEOUT=.TRUE., the information needed to compute the free-energy gradient is written in the REPORT file after each molecular-dynamics step ( MDALGO =1 | 2), check the lines after the header: For the theory of the blue-moon ensemble we refer to here .
