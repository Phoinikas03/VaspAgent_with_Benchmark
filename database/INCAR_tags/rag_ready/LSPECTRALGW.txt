LSPECTRALGW = .FALSE. | .TRUE. Default: LSPECTRALGW = .FALSE. Description: LSPECTRALGW specifies to use the spectral method for calculating the self-energy. If LSPECTRALGW = .TRUE. is set, the imaginary part of the self-energy {\displaystyle \Sigma(\omega)= G W} {\displaystyle \Sigma(\omega)= G W} is calculated from the imaginary part of screened potential {\displaystyle W(\omega)} {\displaystyle W(\omega)} by shifting the poles of {\displaystyle W } {\displaystyle W } by {\displaystyle \pm \epsilon } {\displaystyle \pm \epsilon } , where {\displaystyle \epsilon } {\displaystyle \epsilon } are the poles of the Green's function {\displaystyle G} {\displaystyle G} . Generally, LSPECTRALGW affects the compute time very little. QP energies also hardly change when LSPECTRALGW is modified. However, LSPECTRALGW = .TRUE. is usually slightly more robust, and should be selected for molecules and other systems with flat dispersion-less bands. One the other hand, LSPECTRALGW = .TRUE. seems to converge slightly slower, as the complex shift CSHIFT is decreased. Set this flag, if the QP energies show erratic behavior, for instance, if QP energies or Z-factors are not in the expected range of values (0.5<Z<0.9).
