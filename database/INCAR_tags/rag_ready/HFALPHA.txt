HFALPHA =  Description: HFALPHA sets the decay constant used in the method of Massida, Posternak, and Baldereschi, which is activated by HFRCUT =0. HFALPHA sets the decay constant in the error-function-like charge distribution for the method of Massida, Posternak, and Baldereschi  . The error-function-like charge distribution is used to calculate the difference between the isolated probe charge and the periodically repeated probe charge in a homogenous background. The default for HFALPHA is 6/sqrt( ENMAX )/(2pi) in atomic units. This usually yields robust and accurate results in the range of meV compared to the Ewald summation used for a regular k-mesh. This is the default approach used to implement the convergence corrections of the Coulomb singularity in Hartree-Fock calculations. This does not work correctly for bandstructure calculations using the 0-weight scheme or KPOINTS_OPT because the correction is only applied for points in the regular grid. To overcome this problem we recommend using the Coulomb truncation methods using HFRCUT .
