EVENONLY = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: EVENONLY = .FALSE. Description: EVENONLY =.TRUE. selects a subset of k -points for the representation of the Fock exchange potential, with C 1 = C 2 = C 3 =1, and n 1 + n 2 + n 3 even. One may restrict the sum over q in the Fock exchange potential (or one of its short range counterparts) to a subset, { q k }, of the full ( N 1 x N 2 x N 3 ) k -point set, { k }, for which the following holds where b 1,2,3 are the reciprocal lattice vectors of the primitive cell, and C i is the integer grid reduction factor along reciprocal lattice direction b i . EVENONLY =.TRUE. selects a subset of k -points with C 1 = C 2 = C 3 =1, and n 1 + n 2 + n 3 even. It reduces the computational work load for HF type calculations by a factor two, but is only sensible for high symmetry cases (such as sc, fcc or bcc cells).
