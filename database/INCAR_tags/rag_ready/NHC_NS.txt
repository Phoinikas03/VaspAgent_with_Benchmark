NHC_NS =  1 | 3 | 7 Default: NHC_NS = 1 Description: The number of subdivisions of each RESPA step used in the integration step used in propagation of thermostat variables in Nosé-Hoover–chain (NHC) thermostat . The RESPA steps used in in propagation of thermostat variables in Nosé-Hoover–chain (NHC) thermostat are treated by Suzuki-Yoshida scheme   , whereby each step is subdivided further into NHC_NS parts. First, fourth, and sixth order schemes with, 1, 3, and 7 steps, respectively, are supported. Related tags and articles NHC_PERIOD , NHC_NRESPA , NHC thermostat
