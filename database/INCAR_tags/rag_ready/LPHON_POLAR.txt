LPHON_POLAR = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LPHON_POLAR = .FALSE. Description: LPHON_POLAR includes dipole-dipole corrections in the computation of the phonon dispersion. For this mode, PHON_DIELECTRIC and PHON_BORN_CHARGES must also be set. If the material is non-metallic and polar (i.e. two or more atoms in the unit cell carry nonzero Born effective charge tensors), a special treatment of the long-range dipole-dipole interaction is required to obtain a smooth phonon dispersion. This is activated by setting LPHON_POLAR =.TRUE. and supplying the static dielectric tensor ( PHON_DIELECTRIC ) and the Born-effective charges ( PHON_BORN_CHARGES ) which can be obtained in a separate VASP calculation using the LEPSILON or LCALCEPS tag. The dipole-dipole part of the interatomic force-constants is evaluated using an Ewald summation with the number of {\displaystyle \mathbf{G}} {\displaystyle \mathbf{G}} vectors determined by the cutoff length ( PHON_G_CUTOFF ). In the case of metals, the dielectric function is infinite, for nonpolar semiconductors the Born effective charges are zero which in both cases means that the long-range interatomic force-constants are zero and this dipole-dipole correction does not need to be applied.
