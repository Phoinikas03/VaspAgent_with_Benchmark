ML_MCONF_NEW =  Default: ML_MCONF_NEW = 5 Description: This tag sets the number of configurations that are stored temporarily as candidates for the training data in the machine learning force field method. The use of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: here . If force fields are reparameterized ( ML_MODE = select ), calculations are usually more efficient if this parameter is increased to values around 10-16 and setting ML_CDOUB = 4 . This is particularly relevant if the ML_AB file is large. Related tags and articles Examples that use this tag ML_LMLFF , ML_MCONF , ML_CTIFOR , ML_CDOUB
