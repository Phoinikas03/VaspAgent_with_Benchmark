CUTOFF_MU =  (  ) Description: CUTOFF_MU specifies the energy cutoff {\displaystyle \mu} {\displaystyle \mu} in eV for the function specified by CUTOFF_MU . The value {\displaystyle \mu} {\displaystyle \mu} of CUTOFF_MU corresponds to the energy cutoff of the cutoff function used to obtain Wannier functions with the one-shot method . The meaning of {\displaystyle \mu} {\displaystyle \mu} depends on the CUTOFF_TYPE tag. For spin-polarized calculations ( ISPIN = 2 ), two values can be specified for CUTOFF_MU , one for each spin channel. If only a single value is specified, it will be used for both spin channels. The default value is computed by first determining the Fermi level of the system if it had NUM_WANN orbitals occupied and multiplying by 0.8. This gives reasonable freedom to determine the unitary transformation {\displaystyle U_{mn\mathbf{k}}} {\displaystyle U_{mn\mathbf{k}}} from Bloch states to Wannier functions.
