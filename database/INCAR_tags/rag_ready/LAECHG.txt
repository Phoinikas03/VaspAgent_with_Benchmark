LAECHG = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LAECHG = .FALSE. Description: when LAECHG =.TRUE. the all-electron charge density will be reconstructed explicitly and written to files. If LAECHG =.TRUE. is set VASP will reconstruct the all-electron charge density on the so-called "fine" FFT-grid. This "fine" FFT-grid consists of NGXF x NGYF x NGZF points in real space ( i.e. , the grid that is used to represent the augmented pseudo charge densities of the USPP and PAW methods). In fact, for LAECHG =.TRUE., VASP will reconstruct three distinct all-electron densities: the core density. the proto-atomic valence density (overlapping atomic charge densities). the self-consistent valence density. These are written to the files AECCAR0 , AECCAR1 , and AECCAR2 , respectively. The first two of these files are written at the start of the run, whereas the last is written at the end after self-consistency has been reached. N.B.: In the language of the PAW method an "all-electron" density does not refer to the density of all electrons , instead it denotes a density that includes all the nodal features near the nucleus associated with the true (as opposed to the pseudized ) one-electron orbitals. Within the PAW method, the all-electron density arising from the one-electron pseudo orbitals {\displaystyle \{ \widetilde{\psi}_{n\mathbf{k}} \}} {\displaystyle \{ \widetilde{\psi}_{n\mathbf{k}} \}} is given by: Normally one does not attempt to reconstruct all-electron densities explicitly since the second term on the right-hand side varies rapidly near the nuclei and is too costly to expand in-plane waves (see the bit about augmentation and compensation charges ). For LAECHG =.TRUE., however, this reconstruction is exactly the thing that is done. Related tags and articles AECCAR0 , AECCAR1 , AECCAR2 Examples that use this tag
