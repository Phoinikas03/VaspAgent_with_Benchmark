LSEPB =  Default: LSEPB = .FALSE. Description: Specifies whether the partial charge density is summed up for all selected bands or separated and printed out in different files. If LPARD = .TRUE. the partial charge density is calculated for a subset of bands selected via the IBAND , NBMOD , and EINT tags. If LSEPB is set to .TRUE., separate PARCHG.nb.ALLK or PARCHG.nb.nk files are created, dependent on the LSEPK tag. If LSEPB = .FALSE., the output is written to PARCHG or PARCHG.ALLB.nk, again depending on LSEPK . Here are four examples to illustrate the interplay of LSEPB and LSEPK . in all cases, the following settings apply, selecting three specific bands and two k points IBAND = 9 10 11 , NBMOD = 3 , and KPUSE = 1 34 : LSEPB = .FALSE. , LSEPK = .FALSE. LSEPB = .TRUE. , LSEPK = .FALSE. LSEPB = .FALSE. , LSEPK = .TRUE. LSEPB = .TRUE. , LSEPK = .TRUE.
