LPEAD = .TRUE. | .FALSE Default: LPEAD = .FALSE. Description: for LPEAD =.TRUE., the derivative of the cell-periodic part of the orbitals w.r.t. k , |grad k u n k ⟩, is calculated using finite differences ("perturbation expansion after discretization" (PEAD)   ). The derivative of the cell-periodic part of the orbitals w.r.t. k , k , |grad k u n k ⟩, may be written as: where H( k ) and S( k ) are the Hamiltonian and overlap operator for the cell-periodic part of the orbitals, and the sum over n ´ must include a sufficiently large number of unoccupied states. It may also be found as the solution to the following linear Sternheimer equation (see LEPSILON ): Alternatively one may compute {\displaystyle \nabla_{\mathbf{k}} \tilde{u}_{n\mathbf{k}}} {\displaystyle \nabla_{\mathbf{k}} \tilde{u}_{n\mathbf{k}}} from finite differences ( LPEAD =.TRUE.): where m runs over the N occupied bands of the system, Δ k = k j+1 - k j , and As mentioned in the context of the self-consistent response to finite electric fields one may derive analoguous expressions for |grad k u n k ⟩ using higher-order finite difference approximations. When LPEAD =.TRUE., VASP will compute |grad k u n k ⟩ using the aforementioned finite difference scheme. The order of the finite difference approximation can be specified by means of the IPEAD -tag (default: IPEAD =4). These tags may be used in combination with LOPTICS =.TRUE. and LEPSILON =.TRUE.. N.B. Please note that LPEAD = .TRUE. is not supported for metallic systems .
