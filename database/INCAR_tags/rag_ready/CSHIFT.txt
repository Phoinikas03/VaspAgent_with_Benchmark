CSHIFT =  Description: CSHIFT sets a Lorentzian broadening in eV of the dielectric tensor via the complex shift η in the Kramers-Kronig transformation of the response function. The default CSHIFT =0.1 is perfectly acceptable for most calculations and causes a slight smoothing of the real part of the dielectric function. If the gap is very small (i.e. approaching two times CSHIFT ), slight inaccuracies in the static dielectric constant are possible, which can be remedied by decreasing CSHIFT . If CSHIFT is further decreased, it is strongly recommended to increase the frequency grid by setting NEDOS to values around 2000.
