LPHON_DISPERSION = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Description: LPHON_DISPERSION requests the calculation of the phonon dispersion along the q-point path supplied in file QPOINTS (same format as KPOINTS ). After the computation of the force constants using finite differences ( IBRION =5,6) or density-functional perturbation theory ( IBRION =7,8) on a supercell it is possible to compute the phonon dispersion for the equivalent primitive cell determined by VASP by setting LPHON_DISPERSION =.TRUE.
