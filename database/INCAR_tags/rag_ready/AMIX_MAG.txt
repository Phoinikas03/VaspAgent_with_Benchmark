AMIX_MAG =  Default: AMIX_MAG = 1.6 Description: Linear mixing parameter for the magnetization density. The default mixing parameters for spinpolarized calculations are: These settings are consistent with an (initial) spin enhancement factor of 4, which is usually a reasonable approximation. There are only a few other parameter combinations that can be tried if convergence turns out to be very slow. In particular, for slabs, magnetic systems, and insulating systems (e.g. molecules and clusters), an initial "linear mixing" can result in faster convergence than the Kerker model function.  One can therefore try to use the following setting Related tags and articles IMIX , INIMIX , MAXMIX , AMIX , BMIX , BMIX_MAG , AMIN , MIXPRE , WC Examples that use this tag
