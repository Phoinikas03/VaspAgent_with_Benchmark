LMIXTAU = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LMIXTAU = .FALSE. Description: send the kinetic-energy density through the density mixer as well. In many cases, the density-mixing scheme works well enough without passing the kinetic-energy density through the mixer. Therefore VASP uses LMIXTAU =.FALSE. per default. However, when the self-consistency cycle fails to converge for one of the algorithms exploiting density mixing , e.g, IALGO =38 or 48, we recommend setting LMIXTAU =.TRUE..
