ML_RDES_SPARSDES =  Default: ML_RDES_SPARSDES = 0.5 Description: Sets the ratio of descriptors kept during angular-descriptor sparsification. During angular-descriptor sparsification ( ML_LSPARSDES =T), insignificant angular descriptors are removed based on a leverage scoring. The percentage of angular descriptors that are kept is determined by the value of ML_RDES_SPARSDES , which must be chosen between {\displaystyle 0 < r \leq 1} {\displaystyle 0 < r \leq 1} . In practice, we recommend scanning a range between 0.1 to 0.9. Removing angular descriptors increases the performance of a force field, but it decreases accuracy at the same time. One method of finding the optimal tradeoff between accuracy and performance is to do a Pareto front with run time on the x-axis and accuracy on the y-axis.
