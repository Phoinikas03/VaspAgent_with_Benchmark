ML_CDOUB =  Description: This tag controls the criterion for "enforced" DFT calculations within the machine learning force field method. The usage of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: here . If at any time, the estimated force errors are ML_CDOUB times larger than the Bayesian threshold (i.e. "critically" high), a first principles calculation is performed and a new force field is immediately generated (even if the counter for sampling is below the minimum amount of sampled structures ML_NMDINT ).
