IMAGES =  Default: IMAGES = 0 Description: Defines the number of VASP calculations in separate directories, (e.g., 01, 02, 03, etc.) for nudged elastic band calculations, parallel tempering , and thermodynamic integration . IMAGES sets the number of independent VASP calculations in separate directories. The primary INCAR file should be located in the root directory. Other files such as KPOINTS , POTCAR , and POSCAR can be placed in subdirectories, e.g., 01, 02, 03, etc., or in the root directory. Files in subdirectories take precedence over those in the root directory. See use cases described below. File handling When VASP starts, it reads the file INCAR in the root directory. Subsequently, VASP splits the MPI communicator into subgroups for each image. If an INCAR file is present in the subdirectories 01, 02, 03, ..., VASP will process those afterward. Otherwise, VASP continues reading from the root INCAR file. You can also provide image-specific data in the root INCAR file if the files are very similar Here, images 3 and 4 would use TEBEG =600 because the value is not specified for the image. The files KPOINTS and POTCAR will be read from the subdirectory if available and from the root directory otherwise. The POSCAR file and all other input files are always read from the subdirectories. All output files (including OUTCAR and OSZICAR ) are always written to the subdirectories. To summarize, to run a calculation with IMAGES , you provide: an INCAR file in the root directory optionally an overwriting INCAR file in the subdirectories POSCAR files in the subdirectories KPOINTS and POTCAR either in the root or in the subdirectories Use cases Related tags and articles VCAIMAGES , LTEMPER , nudged-elastic-bands how-to , SPRING Examples that use this tag
