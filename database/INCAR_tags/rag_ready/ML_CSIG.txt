ML_CSIG =  Default: ML_CSIG = {\displaystyle 0.4} {\displaystyle 0.4} Description: Parameter used in the automatic determination of threshold ML_CTIFOR for error estimation in the machine learning force field method. The usage of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: here . The standard error of the history of maximum estimated errors of the forces ( ML_MHIS ) and it's slope must be below ML_CSIG and ML_CSLOPE so that an update of the threshold for the maximum estimated error of forces ML_CTIFOR can take place.
