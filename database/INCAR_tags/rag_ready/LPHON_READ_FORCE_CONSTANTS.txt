LPHON_READ_FORCE_CONSTANTS = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Description: LPHON_READ_FORCE_CONSTANTS read the force constants from a vaspin.h5 file containing the force constants computed with a previous VASP run. After the computation of the force constants using finite-differences ( IBRION =5,6) or density-functional perturbation theory ( IBRION =7,8) on a supercell the force constants are written to the vaspout.h5 file. To plot the phonon dispersion on a different path the user can modify the QPOINTS file and read the force constants computed previously (i.e. without performing the finite-differences computations on supercells again). To do so copy vaspout.h5 to vaspin.h5 and set LPHON_READ_FORCE_CONSTANTS =.TRUE. in the INCAR file. Note that when this is set only the phonon dispersion is performed and then VASP quits without running any additional calculation specified in the INCAR file.
