PHON_DOS = 0 | 1 | 2 Description: Select the approach to use when computing the phonon density-of-states (DOS). The possible values are To get a representative density of states the QPOINTS file should specify a regular mesh. When line mode in the QPOINTS file and gaussian smearing (PHON_DOS=1) is used, the phonon density of states will still be computed but the results are not reliable.
