XC = Combination of functionals Description: Specifies a combination of exchange-correlation functionals. A combination of semilocal (LDA, GGA, and METAGGA) functionals can be set with the XC tag, which provides much more flexibility in the choice of the functional compared to the GGA and METAGGA tags. The functionals that can be combined are the functionals implemented in VASP (listed at GGA and METAGGA ) and the functionals implemented in Libxc    (listed on the Libxc website  ). The combination can consist of up to 100 components; for each, a multiplication factor can be set with the XC_C tag. Examples of INCAR 50% of PBE  and 50% of PBEsol  SCAN exchange  combined with PBE correlation  70% of B88  (from Libxc) and 30% of PBE  for exchange and 100% of LYP (from Libxc) for correlation  15% of HF, 63.75% of PBE  , and 21.25% of B88  (from Libxc) for exchange and 75% of PBE  and 25% of LYP  (from Libxc) for correlation 15% of HF, 63.75% of PBE  , and 21.25% of SCAN  for exchange and 75% of PBE  and 25% of SCAN  for correlation Related tags and articles XC_C , GGA , METAGGA LIBXC1 , LIBXC2 , ALDAX , ALDAC , AGGAX , AGGAC , AMGGAX , AMGGAC Examples that use this tag References
