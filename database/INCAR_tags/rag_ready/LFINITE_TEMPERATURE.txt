LFINITE_TEMPERATURE =  Default: LFINITE_TEMPERATURE = .FALSE. Description: LFINITE_TEMPERATURE switches on the finite-temperature formalism of many-body perturbation theory for adiabatic-connection-fluctuation-dissipation-theorem (ACFDT)/GW calculations. This feature is available as of VASP.6.1.0 for ACFDT/random-phase-approximation (RPA), i.e., ALGO =ACFDT, ACFDTR, ACFDTRK, and low-scaling GW calculations , i.e., ALGO =EVGW0R, GWR. For LFINITE_TEMPERATURE =.TRUE., a compressed Matsubara-frequency grid is used (instead of the zero-temperature formalism of many-body perturbation theory). This allows for GW and RPA calculations for metallic systems.  To this end, the electronic temperature is set with the k-point smearing parameter SIGMA in units of eV, e.g. a value of {\displaystyle \sigma=1 eV} {\displaystyle \sigma=1 eV} corresponds to a electronic temperature of {\displaystyle T\approx 11 604 K} {\displaystyle T\approx 11 604 K} .
