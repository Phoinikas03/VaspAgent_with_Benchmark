LMAXMIX =  Default: LMAXMIX = 2 Description: LMAXMIX controls up to which l -quantum number the one-center PAW charge densities are passed through the charge density mixer and written to the CHGCAR file. Higher l -quantum numbers ( l > LMAXMIX ) are not handled by the density mixer (these components of the one-center charge density are set to the value corresponding to the present orbitals). Usually, it is not necessary to increase LMAXMIX , but the following cases are exceptions: DFT+U calculations require, in many cases, an increase of LMAXMIX to 4 for d -electrons (or 6 for f -elements) to obtain fast convergence to the ground state. The CHGCAR file will contain the one-center PAW occupancy matrices up to LMAXMIX . When the CHGCAR file is read and kept fixed in the course of the calculations ( ICHARG =11), the results will not necessarily be identical to a self-consistent run. The deviations will be large for DFT+U calculations. For the calculation of band structures within the DFT+U approach, it is strictly required to increase LMAXMIX to 4 for d -elements and to 6 for f -elements. SDFT calculations that consider noncollinear magnetism often require slow mixing of the spin density up to 4 for d -elements and up to 6 for f -elements to obtain fast convergence to the ground state.
