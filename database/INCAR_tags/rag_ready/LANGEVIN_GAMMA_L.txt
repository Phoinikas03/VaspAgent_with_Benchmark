LANGEVIN_GAMMA_L =  Default: LANGEVIN_GAMMA_L = 0 Description: LANGEVIN_GAMMA_L specifies the friction coefficient (in ps -1 ) for lattice degrees-of-freedom in case of Parrinello-Rahman dynamics (in case VASP was compiled with -Dtbdyn ). When running NpT simulations with a Langevin thermostat  ( MDALGO =3), using the method of Parrinello and Rahman ,   the friction coefficient for lattice degrees-of-freedom have to be specified (in ps -1 ) by means of the LANGEVIN_GAMMA_L -tag. A fictitious mass for the lattice degrees-of-freedom has to be assigned using the PMASS tag. The friction coefficients gamma for the atomic degrees-of-freedom are specified using the LANGEVIN_GAMMA -tag.
