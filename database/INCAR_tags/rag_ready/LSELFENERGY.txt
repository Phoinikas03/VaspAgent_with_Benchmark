LSELFENERGY =  Default: LSELFENERGY = .FALSE. Description: Controls whether the frequency-dependent self-energy is calculated or not. If LSELFENERGY = .FALSE. (default), quasi-particle (QP) shifts are evaluated. If LSELFENERGY = .TRUE. , the frequency dependent self-energy {\displaystyle \langle \psi_{n {\mathbf{k}}} | \Sigma(\omega) |\psi_{n {\mathbf{k}}} \rangle } {\displaystyle \langle \psi_{n {\mathbf{k}}} | \Sigma(\omega) |\psi_{n {\mathbf{k}}} \rangle } is evaluated and printed to vasprun.xml . An example output looks like the following: Format Real frequencies If quartic-scaling GW algorithms are selected, e.g. ALGO =EVGW0, the first column corresponds to points on the real-frequency axis (in eV). The second and third columns are the real and imaginary parts of the self-energy (in eV) at a given band index and k point. To identify the band index and k point, the ordering has to be taken from the OUTCAR : Instead of the QP shifts, a small set of self-energy points are printed to OUTCAR , similar to the following output Here, the first and second band at the Gamma point are printed. The line with selfenergy along real axis contains band No., the KS energy, and the occupation of this state. The output in vasprun.xml has the same ordering of bands and k points, i.e., the band index is always the fastest. The frequency grid cannot be controlled. It is always 1000 points in the range of -150 to 150. Imaginary frequencies For low-scaling GW algorithms , the QP shifts are evaluated and printed to OUTCAR for both, LSELFENERGY =T and F. For LSELFENERGY =T, the vasprun.xml file additionally contains the self-energy for a given band index and k point on the imaginary-frequency axis: To identify the band index and k point, the ordering has to be taken from the QP shifts block in the OUTCAR . The band index is faster than the k point. The imaginary frequency is selected by the Minimax routines  , and the number of points depends on NOMEGA .
