NEDOS =  Default: NEDOS = {\displaystyle 301} {\displaystyle 301} Description: Number of grid points for the electronic density of states (DOS) and dielectric function . The energy range between EMIN and EMAX is divided into NEDOS intervals to obtain the grid points. The DOS for the corresponding energy is written in the DOSCAR file. The smallest peak widths from the dispersion of the respective bands can be estimated by having a look at the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues written in OUTCAR . NEDOS has to be chosen sufficiently large to resolve this dispersion. In addition, the energy interval defined by EMIN and EMAX can be modified. NEDOS is also used to set the total number of frequency points when calculating the dielectric function . Related tags and articles EMIN , EMAX , DOSCAR Examples that use this tag
