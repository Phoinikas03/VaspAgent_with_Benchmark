LORBMOM = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LORBMOM = .FALSE. Description: LORBMOM specifies whether the orbital moments are written out or not (in a calculation using LSORBIT =.TRUE.). If LORBMOM =.TRUE. is set VASP will use the projectors of the PAW potentials to calculate the orbital moment within the PAW spheres, and write them to the OUTCAR file.
