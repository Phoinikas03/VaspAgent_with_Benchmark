ISPIN = 1 | 2 Default: ISPIN = 1 Description: ISPIN specifies spin polarization. ISPIN =1: non-spin-polarized calculations are performed. ISPIN =2: spin-polarized calculations (collinear) are performed. By combining ISPIN with MAGMOM collinear magnetism can be studied. Related tags and articles MAGMOM Examples that use this tag
