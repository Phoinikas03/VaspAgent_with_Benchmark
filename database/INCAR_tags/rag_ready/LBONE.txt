LBONE = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LBONE = .FALSE. Description: LBONE adds the small B -component to the chemical shift tensor. LBONE restores the small B -component of the wave function inside the PAW spheres in the linear-response calculation of the NMR chemical shift tensor. The POTCARs used in VASP are scalar-relativistic and the AE-partial waves are solutions of the scalar-relativistic Kohn-Sham equation for the spherical atom. These have a large ( A ) and a small ( B ) component. The latter is not retained on the POTCAR, but approximately restored when LBONE =.TRUE.  . LBONE only affects the one-center valence contributions to the chemical shift. The contribution of the core electrons includes the B -component by default.
