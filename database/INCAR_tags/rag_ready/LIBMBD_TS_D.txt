LIBMBD_TS_D =  Default: LIBMBD_TS_D = 20 Description: LIBMBD_TS_D sets the value of the damping parameter {\displaystyle d} {\displaystyle d} in the Tkatchenko-Scheffler method  as implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . LIBMBD_TS_D allows to choose the value of the damping parameter {\displaystyle d} {\displaystyle d} in the Tkatchenko-Scheffler method  as implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . The value is internally passed to the libMBD input ts_d described at the page  . LIBMBD_TS_D is the same as the VDW_D tag that is used for the VASP implementation of the Tkatchenko-Scheffler method. libMBD is a separate library package that has to be downloaded  and compiled before VASP is compiled with the corresponding precompiler options and links to the libraries .
