WRT_POTENTIAL = string Default: WRT_POTENTIAL = None Description: Select which component of the local potential to be written as a post-processing step. WRT_POTENTIAL can select one or multiple local potentials on the real-space grid in the unit cell to be written, e.g., or The output is written to vaspout.h5 and can be accessed either by py4vasp or HDF5 command-line tools (h5ls, h5dump). The above allows the creation of a Python dictionary with the potential data. The above shows the table of contents of vaspout.h5 . Depending on the keywords specified with WRT_POTENTIAL and the system it yields The grid density can be increased by choosing a higher value for ENCUT or explicitly by NGX , NGY , NGZ . The first dimension of the datasets in /results/potential is 1 for nonmagnetic calculation, 2 for spin-polarized calculation, and 4 for noncollinear calculations. In case the potential is scalar, i.e., has no B-field-like contribution that couples to the magnetization, only the 1st component exists. Hence, for hartree and ionic , the first dimension is 1. The components for the magnetic calculations correspond to the spinor representation with the scalar potential in the first component and the B-field in the second ( ISPIN =2) or {\displaystyle B_1} {\displaystyle B_1} , {\displaystyle B_2} {\displaystyle B_2} and {\displaystyle B_3} {\displaystyle B_3} in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th component ( LNONCOLLINEAR =T) in the basis of Pauli matrices {\displaystyle \{\sigma_1} {\displaystyle \{\sigma_1} , {\displaystyle \sigma_2} {\displaystyle \sigma_2} , {\displaystyle \mathbf{\sigma}_3\}} {\displaystyle \mathbf{\sigma}_3\}} given by SAXIS . WRT_POTENTIAL can be run as a post-processing step by restarting from a converged CHGCAR and setting ALGO =None. It is available for VASP >= 6.4.3.
