NBSEBLOCKO =  Description: NBSEBLOCKO specifies the blocking factor for the occupied states when setting up the BSE Hamiltonian. By default, the construction of the BSE Hamiltonian in VASP is parallelized over k -points, such that each MPI rank can compute a pair of k -points. This way the BSE Hamiltonian setup can be parallelized with or for spin-polarized case where {\displaystyle \mathrm{NKPTS}} {\displaystyle \mathrm{NKPTS}} is the total number of k -points in the full Brillouin zone. However, if a large number of MPI ranks is used in a calculation with too few k -point, this leads to load imbalance, where some of the MPI ranks will have no data to compute. In such cases, it is recommended to use parallelization over bands. If the parallelization over bands is used, all occupied (unoccupied) bands are divided into and blocks, respectively. Such a band blocking allows VASP to parallelize the setup of the matrix with or for spin-polarized case If neither {\displaystyle \mathrm{NBSEBLOCKV}} {\displaystyle \mathrm{NBSEBLOCKV}} nor {\displaystyle \mathrm{NBSEBLOCKO}} {\displaystyle \mathrm{NBSEBLOCKO}} is specified, no paralliziation over bands is used and {\displaystyle \mathrm{NBLKO=1}} {\displaystyle \mathrm{NBLKO=1}} and {\displaystyle \mathrm{NBLKV=1}} {\displaystyle \mathrm{NBLKV=1}} . We recommend using parallelization over bands only if the number of MPI ranks in the calculation exceeds {\displaystyle \text{total ranks}} {\displaystyle \text{total ranks}} .
