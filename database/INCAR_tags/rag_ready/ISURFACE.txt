KERNEL_TRUNCATION/ISURFACE = 1 | 2 | 3 Description: KERNEL_TRUNCATION/ISURFACE specifies the non-periodic dimension when performing calculations with 2D kernel truncation methods. When performing 2D kernel truncation with KERNEL_TRUNCATION/IDIMENSIONALITY =2, KERNEL_TRUNCATION/ISURFACE specifies which direction is non-periodic. The most common use case is to set KERNEL_TRUNCATION/ISURFACE to the dimension along the surface normal. If the surface normal points in the direction of the x-axis KERNEL_TRUNCATION/ISURFACE = 1, if it is along the y-axis, KERNEL_TRUNCATION/ISURFACE = 2 and if it is along the z-axis, KERNEL_TRUNCATION/ISURFACE = 3.
