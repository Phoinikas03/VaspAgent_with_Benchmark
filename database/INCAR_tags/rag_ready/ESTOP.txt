ESTOP =  Description: ESTOP specifies the stop condition for stochastic MP2. ESTOP defines the energy accuracy in units of eV for each individual tau-point of the two individual MP2 energy contributions (direct MP2 term + exchange MP2 term). Since the statistical errors of each contribution is independent, the standard deviation of the MP2 energy can be estimated as {\displaystyle \sigma = \texttt{ESTOP} * \sqrt{2 \cdot \texttt{NOMEGA}} \;. } {\displaystyle \sigma = \texttt{ESTOP} * \sqrt{2 \cdot \texttt{NOMEGA}} \;. } According to our experience, the error of the resulting MP2 energy can then be safely estimated by {\displaystyle \pm 2 \sigma} {\displaystyle \pm 2 \sigma} . Thus, if you require an MP2 energy with a maximum error of {\displaystyle \Delta} {\displaystyle \Delta} , you should set {\displaystyle \texttt{ESTOP} = \frac{\Delta}{2 \cdot \sqrt{2 \cdot \texttt{NOMEGA}}} \;. } {\displaystyle \texttt{ESTOP} = \frac{\Delta}{2 \cdot \sqrt{2 \cdot \texttt{NOMEGA}}} \;. } See this tutorial for more Information about Laplace transformed MP2.
