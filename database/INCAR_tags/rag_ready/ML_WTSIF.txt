ML_WTSIF =  Description: This tag sets the weight for the scaling of the stress in the training data within the machine learning force field method. ML_IWEIGHT , ML_WTOTEN , ML_WTIFOR , ML_WTSIF form a group of tags which set the normalization and weighting of ab initio training data, i.e. energies, forces and stresses of the training structures. The main control tag is ML_IWEIGHT , please also have a look at its detailed description. If ML_IWEIGHT =1 the weight has unit kBar and is used to divide the data by it. For ML_IWEIGHT =2 and 3 the weights are unitless and multiplicative. Related tags and articles ML_LMLFF , ML_IWEIGHT , ML_WTIFOR , ML_WTOTEN , ML_IALGO_LINREG Examples that use this tag
