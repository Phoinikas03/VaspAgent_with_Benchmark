METAGGA = SCAN | LIBXC | MBJ | ... Default: The functional specified by LEXCH in the POTCAR if GGA and XC are also not specified. Description: Selects a meta-GGA exchange-correlation functional. Available functionals This table lists the meta-GGA functionals available in VASP. There are essentially two types of meta-GGAs, that differ in the variable on which they depend (in addition to {\displaystyle n} {\displaystyle n} and {\displaystyle \nabla n} {\displaystyle \nabla n} ): the kinetic-energy density {\displaystyle \tau} {\displaystyle \tau} or the Laplacian of the density {\displaystyle \nabla^2n} {\displaystyle \nabla^2n} . The names of functionals which end with "_X" and "_C" correspond to exchange-only and correlation functionals, respectively. (1) The exchange-only and correlation-only implementations are available since VASP.6.4.3. (2) In Ref.  TASK exchange is combined with LDA-PW92 correlation.  This can be done with XC =TASK_X PW92_C in INCAR . (3) A few points about the MBJ and LMBJ potentials: POTCAR files: required information Calculations with a meta-GGA that depends on the kinetic-energy density require POTCAR files that include information on the kinetic-energy density of the core electrons. Almost all recent POTCAR files do fulfill this requirement, but there are some notable exceptions like O_GW. To check whether a particular POTCAR contains this information, type: This should yield at least the following lines (for each element on the file): and for PAW datasets with partial core corrections: Aspherical contributions related to one-center terms LASPH =.TRUE. should be selected if a meta-GGA functional is selected. If LASPH =.FALSE., the one-center contributions are only calculated for a spherically averaged density and kinetic-energy density. This means that the one-center contributions to the Kohn-Sham potential are also spherical. Since the PAW method describes the entire space using plane waves, errors are often small even if the non-spherical contributions to the Kohn-Sham potential are neglected inside the PAW spheres (additive augmentation, as opposed to the APW or FLAPW method where the plane wave contribution only describes the interstitial region between the atoms). Anyhow, if the density is strongly non-spherical around some atoms in your structure, LASPH =.TRUE. must be selected. Non-spherical terms are particularly encountered in d- and f-elements, dimers, molecules, and solids with strong directional bonds. Convergence issues If convergence problems are encountered, it is recommended to preconverge the calculations using the PBE functional and start the calculation from the WAVECAR file corresponding to the PBE ground state. Furthermore, ALGO = A (conjugate gradient algorithm for orbitals) is often more stable than charge density mixing, in particular if the system contains vacuum regions.
