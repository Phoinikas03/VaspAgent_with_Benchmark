KPUSE =  Default: KPUSE = not set Description: KPUSE sets a list of k points that contribute to calculating the partial charge density . IBAND selects a subset of k' points for which the partial charge density is calculated when LPARD = .TRUE.. Partial charge densities are written to the PARCHG file, or one of its variants, depending on the setting of LSEPB and LSEPK . E.g. if KPUSE = 1 4 7 the charge density will be calculated for the three k points 1, 4, and 7.
