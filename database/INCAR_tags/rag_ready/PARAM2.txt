PARAM2 =  Default: PARAM2 = 1.0 Description: {\displaystyle \kappa} {\displaystyle \kappa} for GGA =MK, or {\displaystyle \mu} {\displaystyle \mu} for GGA =BO. The PARAM2 tag determines the value corresponding to different parameters depending on the GGA functional that is chosen: {\displaystyle \kappa} {\displaystyle \kappa} in the optB86b  ( {\displaystyle \kappa} {\displaystyle \kappa} is not shown in this work since implicitly set to 1.0), B86R  , and DF3-opt2  exchange functionals, which have the same analytical form and correspond to GGA =MK. PARAM2 should in principle be set to 1.0 for the nonlocal optB86b-vdW functional  , to 0.711357 for the nonlocal rev-vdW-DF2  functional, or to {\displaystyle 0.58} {\displaystyle 0.58} for the vdW-DF3-opt2 nonlocal functional  . {\displaystyle \mu} {\displaystyle \mu} in the optB88  and DF3-opt1  exchange functionals, which have the same analytical form and correspond to GGA =BO. PARAM2 should in principle be set to 0.22 for the nonlocal optB88-vdW functional  or to {\displaystyle 10/81\approx0.1234568} {\displaystyle 10/81\approx0.1234568} for the vdW-DF3-opt1  nonlocal functional.
