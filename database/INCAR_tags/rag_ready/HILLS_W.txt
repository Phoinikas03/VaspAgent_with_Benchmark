HILLS_W =  Default: HILLS_W = {\displaystyle 10^{-3}} {\displaystyle 10^{-3}} Description: HILLS_W specifies the width of the Gaussian hill (in units of the corresponding collective variable) used in metadynamics (in case VASP was compiled with -Dtbdyn ). In metadynamics ( MDALGO =11 | 21), the bias potential is given as Thre parameters ( HILLS_H , HILLS_W , and HILLS_BIN ) must be provided by the user. The width of the Gaussian hills {\displaystyle w} {\displaystyle w} (in units of the corresponding collective variable) is set by HILLS_W .
