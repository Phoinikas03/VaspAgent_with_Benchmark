INCREM =  Default: INCREM = 0 Description: INCREM controls the transformation velocity in the slow-growth approach (in case VASP was compiled with -Dtbdyn ). In slow-growth simulations ( MDALGO =1 | 2), the value of each controlled geometric parameter with STATUS=0 is increased by INCREM in every simulation step. It must be supplied for each controlled geometric parameter for which STATUS=0 was specified in the ICONST -file. Related tags and articles MDALGO , ICONST Examples that use this tag
