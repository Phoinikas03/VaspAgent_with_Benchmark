NKREDZ =  Default: NKREDZ = 1 Description: NKREDZ specifies a reduction factor for the q -point grid representation of the exact exchange potential along reciprocal space direction b 3 . One may restrict the sum over q in the Fock exchange potential (or one of its short range counterparts) to a subset, { q k }, of the full ( N 1 x N 2 x N 3 ) k -point set, { k }, for which the following holds where b 1,2,3 are the reciprocal lattice vectors of the primitive cell, and C i is the integer grid reduction factor along reciprocal lattice direction b i . This leads to a reduction in the computational workload by a factor: In case one sets NKRED , the grid reduction factors will be uniformly set to C 1 = C 2 = C 3 = NKRED . If one wants to specify separate grid reduction factors for C 1 , C 2 , and C 3 one should use C 1 = NKREDX , C 2 = NKREDY , and C 3 = NKREDZ , respectively.
