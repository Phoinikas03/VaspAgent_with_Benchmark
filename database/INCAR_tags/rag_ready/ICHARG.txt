ICHARG = 0 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 5 Description: ICHARG determines how VASP constructs the initial charge density. ICHARG =0 ICHARG =1 ICHARG =2 ICHARG =4 ICHARG =5 ICHARG =10 The initial charge density is of importance in the following cases: If ICHARG ≥10 the charge density remains constant during the run. For all algorithms except IALGO =5X the initial charge density is used to set up the initial Hamiltonian that is used in the first few non-selfconsistent steps, c.f., NELMDL tag.
