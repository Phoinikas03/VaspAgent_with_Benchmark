LWRITE_MMN_AMN = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Description: LWRITE_MMN_AMN =.TRUE. tells the VASP2WANNIER90 interface to write the wannier90.mmn and wannier90.amn files. When running WANNIER90 in library mode ( LWANNIER90_RUN =.TRUE.), the wannier90.mmn and wannier90.amn files are not written. The information these files normally contain is passed on to wannier_run internally. If you want these files to be written anyway, for instance, to be able to run WANNIER90 standalone later on, set LWRITE_MMN_AMN =.TRUE. in the INCAR file.
