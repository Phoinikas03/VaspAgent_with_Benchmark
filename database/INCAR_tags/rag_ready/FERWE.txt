FERWE =  Description: FERWE sets the occupancies of the states for ISMEAR =-2. To set the occupancies, specify The occupancies must be specified for all bands and k points. The band index runs fastest. The occupancies must be between 0 and 1. In the case of spin-polarized calculations ( ISPIN = 2 ), FERWE sets the occupancies of the states in the up-spin channel. Specify the occupancies of the states in the down-spin channel by means of the FERDO tag. Note that the partial occupancies are also written to the OUTCAR file Keep in mind that for systems without spin-polarization the occupations are twice as large in the OUTCAR file than what you should provide for FERWE because of spin degeneracy. You can use FERWE to keep occupancies fixed during ionic relaxations or molecular dynamics simulations. However, keeping the orbital occupancies fixed, requires that the orbital order does not change during the self-consistency cycle or during the optimization of the orbitals. Imagine, for instance, that the eigenenergy of the 65th orbital moves below the orbital energy of the 64th orbital. By default, VASP will order the eigenenergies so that enforcing FERWE will move the electrons to the originally unoccupied 65th orbital because it has now the lower energy. This problem can be often circumvented by specifying LDIAG = .FALSE. in the INCAR file. Related tags and articles FERDO , ISMEAR , NBANDS , LDIAG Examples that use this tag
