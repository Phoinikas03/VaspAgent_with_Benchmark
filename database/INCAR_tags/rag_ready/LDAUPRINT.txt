LDAUPRINT = 0 | 1 Default: LDAUPRINT = 0 Description: LDAUPRINT controls the verbosity of a DFT+U calculation. LDAUPRINT =0: No onsite occupancy matrix is written to the OUTCAR file. LDAUPRINT =1: The spin up and spin down onsite occupancy matrices of the atoms types to which a {\displaystyle U} {\displaystyle U} is applied are written to the OUTCAR file at each iteration (below "onsite density matrix"). The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the total (spin up + spin down) onsite matrix is also written (below "occupancies and eigenvectors").
