ML_CSLOPE =  Default: ML_CSLOPE = {\displaystyle 0.2} {\displaystyle 0.2} Description: Parameter used in the automatic determination of threshold for error estimation in the machine learning force field method. The usage of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: here . The standard error of the history of maximum estimated errors of the forces ( ML_MHIS ) and it's slope must be below ML_CSIG and ML_CSLOPE so that an update of the threshold for the maximum estimated error of forces ML_CTIFOR can take place.
