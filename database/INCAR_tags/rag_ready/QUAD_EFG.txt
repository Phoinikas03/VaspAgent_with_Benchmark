QUAD_EFG =  Default: QUAD_EFG = NTYP*1.0 Description: nuclear quadrupole moment (in millbarn) for the atomic types on the POTCAR file. Setting the QUAD_EFG -tag allows the conversion of the V zz (see LEFG ) values into the quadrupole coupling constants C q often encountered in NMR literature. The conversion formula is as follows ( Q is the element and isotope specific quadrupole moment): The QUAD_EFG -tag specifies the nuclear quadrupole moment in millibarns for each atomic species, in the same order as in the POTCAR file. The output C q is in MHz. An online compilation of nuclear quadrupole moments can be found here or in Ref.  (updated numbers in Ref.  ). Suppose a solid contains Al, C, and Si, then the QUAD_EFG -tag could read: 27 Al is the stable isotope of Al with a natural abundance of 100% and Q =146.6. The stable isotopes 12 C and 13 C are not quadrupolar nuclei, however, the radioactive 11 C is. It has Q =33.27. For Si, all stable isotopes have I≤1/2, making it redundant to calculate a C q . No moments are known for the other isotopes. Related tags and articles LEFG Examples that use this tag References
