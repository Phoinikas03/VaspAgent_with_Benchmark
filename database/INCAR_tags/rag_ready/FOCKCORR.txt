FOCKCORR = 1 | 2 Description: The tag FOCKCORR determines how the Coulomb convergence corrections are applied. The Coulomb potential in reciprocal space diverges for small G vectors. To alleviate this issue and improve the convergence of the exact exchange integral with respect to supercell size (or k-point mesh density) different methods have been proposed: the auxiliary function methods  , probe-charge Ewald  ( HFALPHA ), and Coulomb truncation methods  ( HFRCUT ). These mostly involve modifying the Coulomb Kernel in a way that yields the same result as the unmodified kernel within the limit of large supercell sizes. These corrections are implemented in VASP either by changing the {\displaystyle \mathbf{G}=0} {\displaystyle \mathbf{G}=0} component of the Coulomb kernel when FOCKCORR =1 with {\displaystyle \chi} {\displaystyle \chi} being the value of the correction and depends on whether HFALPHA or HFRCUT are set, or by including the original orbital scaled by the convergence correction when FOCKCORR =2 For Hartree-Fock or hybrid functional calculations, either FOCKCORR =1 or FOCKCORR =2 can be used and should yield the same results when LMAXFOCKAE =-1 and there are no aliasing errors in the exact exchange (see PRECFOCK for more details). For post-DFT methods such as ACDFT, GW, and BSE the FOCKCORR =2 should be used because the overlap densities are reconstructed in the plane-wave grid (see LMAXFOCKAE tag). Note that in the case FOCKCORR =2 the corrections are only applied to orbitals in the {\displaystyle \mathbf{q}} {\displaystyle \mathbf{q}} regular grid used to describe the exact exchange potential so this method cannot be used to compute band structures where this potential is applied to orbitals {\displaystyle n\mathbf{k}} {\displaystyle n\mathbf{k}} not in the {\displaystyle m\mathbf{q}} {\displaystyle m\mathbf{q}} set. In previous versions of VASP, FOCKCORR =1 was used when ALGO =Normal; LFOCKACE =.FALSE. and FOCKCORR =2 when ALGO =All or ALGO =Normal; LFOCKACE =.TRUE. .
