IBAND =  Default: IBAND = not set Description: IBAND sets a list of bands that contribute to calculating the partial charge density . IBAND selects a subset of bands for which the partial charge density is calculated when LPARD = .TRUE.. Partial charge densities are written to the PARCHG file, or one of its variants, depending on the setting of LSEPB and LSEPK . E.g. if IBAND = 20 21 22 23 45 the charge density will be calculated for the four bands 20 to 23 and band 45, and NBMOD will be set to 5.
