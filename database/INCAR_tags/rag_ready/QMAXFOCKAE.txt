QMAXFOCKAE =  Description: Controls at which wave vectors the local augmentation charges are fitted to obtain an accurate charge augmentation on the plane-wave grid. We do not recommend setting these tags manually, except after careful inspection of the VASP code (fast_aug.F). The default values are 6.0 Angstrom -1 if NMAXFOCKAE =1 (corresponding to 140 eV), and 5.0 and 10 Angstrom -1 (corresponding to 95 eV and 380 eV) for NMAXFOCKAE =2.
