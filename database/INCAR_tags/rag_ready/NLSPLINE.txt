NLSPLINE = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: NLSPLINE = .FALSE. Description: construct the PAW projectors in reciprocal space using spline interpolation so that they are k -differentiable. For NLSPLINE =.TRUE., the PAW projectors in reciprocal space ( LREAL =.FALSE.) are set up using a spline interpolation so that they are k differentiable. This improves the susceptibility contribution to the chemical shifts. It only slightly affects the other contributions to the chemical shifts. It is advised to set NLSPLINE =.TRUE. if and only if PAW projectors are applied in reciprocal space and chemical shifts are calculated, i.e., if and only if LREAL =.FALSE. and LCHIMAG =.TRUE. As this option also gives slightly different total energies, it is advised to use the default NLSPLINE =.FALSE. in all other calculations for reasons of compatibility. Real-space projectors are k differentiable by construction, hence do not require to set NLSPLINE =.TRUE. Related tags and articles LCHIMAG , DQ , ICHIBARE , LNMR_SYM_RED Examples that use this tag
