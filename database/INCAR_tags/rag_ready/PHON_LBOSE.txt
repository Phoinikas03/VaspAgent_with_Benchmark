PHON_LBOSE =  Default: PHON_LBOSE = .TRUE. Description: This flag determines whether random structures in the Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling are created according to Bose-Einstein or Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. For PHON_LBOSE = .TRUE. Bose-Einstein statistics is used. For PHON_LBOSE = .FALSE. Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is used. For further usage of this tag see: Electron-phonon interactions from Monte-Carlo sampling .
