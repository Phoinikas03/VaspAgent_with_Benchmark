IALGO = -1 | 2-4 | 5-8 | 15-18 | 28 | 38 | 44-48 | 53-58 Description: IALGO selects the algorithm to optimize the orbitals. Conjugate gradient algorithms The band-by-band conjugate gradient algorithms are no longer maintained or supported. IALGO =5-8: Conjugate gradient algorithms IALGO =15-18: Conjugate gradient algorithms IALGO =28: Conjugate gradient algorithm The blocked-Davidson scheme IALGO =38: Blocked-Davidson algorithm ( ALGO =N). RMM-DIIS IALGO =44-48: Residual minimization method direct inversion in the iterative subspace ( ALGO = F). IALGO =44-48 does not support hybrid functionals. Direct optimization IALGO =53-58: Treat total free energy as variational quantity and minimize the functional completely selfconsistently    . The damped MD algorithm can be combined with LDIAG =.FALSE. to conserve the initial orbital order (when orbitals are read from the WAVECAR file). Miscellaneous IALGO =-1: Performance test. IALGO =2: Orbitals and one-electron energies are kept fixed. IALGO =3: Orbitals are kept fixed. IALGO =4: Orbitals are updated by applying a sub-space rotation. IALGO =90: Exact Diagonalization. This flag selects an exact diagonalization of the one-electron Hamiltonian. This requires a fairly large amount of memory and should be selected with caution. Specifically, we recommend selecting this algorithm to prepare the WAVECAR for RPA or GW calculations, where many unoccupied orbitals are calculated (more than 30-50 % of the states spanned by the full plane-wave basis). To speed up the calculations, we recommend performing a routine ground-state calculation before calculating the unoccupied states.
