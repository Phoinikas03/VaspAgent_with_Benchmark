IRC_DIRECTION = -1 | 1 Default: IRC_DIRECTION = 1 Description: Defines the direction of the initial displacement of the initial transition-state structure in IRC calculations . Defines the direction of the initial displacement of the initial transition-state structure along the unstable direction (corresponding to Hesse matrix eigenmode with negative force constant) used in IRC calculations . Only the values 1 and -1 are allowed, corresponding to the parallel and the antiparallel directions, respectively.
