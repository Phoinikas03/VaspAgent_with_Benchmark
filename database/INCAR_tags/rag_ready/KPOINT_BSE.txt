KPOINT_BSE =  (optionally ,,) Description: KPOINT_BSE specifies the k-point index at which VASP calculates the dielectric matrix. In the simplest form, one can specify Select the desired k point from the list of k points in the OUTCAR file. Additionally, a shift by an arbitrary reciprocal lattice vector can be supplied by specifying three additional integer numbers: This allows calculating the dielectric function at a k point outside of the first Brillouin zone corresponding to where {\displaystyle \bold{b}_{i}} {\displaystyle \bold{b}_{i}} are the reciprocal-lattice vectors of the unit cell.
