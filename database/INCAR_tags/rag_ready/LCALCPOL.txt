LCALCPOL = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LCALCPOL = .FALSE. Description: LCALCPOL =.TRUE. switches on the evaluation of the Berry phase expressions for the macroscopic electronic polarization in accordance with the so-called Modern Theory of Polarization . For LCALCPOL =.TRUE., VASP calculates the electronic contribution to the polarization, along the three reciprocal lattice vectors G i , i=1,2,3, (i.e. Σ i P · G i ) in a single run (unlike LBERRY =.TRUE.). An example: The fluorine displacement dipole (Born effective charge) in NaF With INCAR file: KPOINTS file: POSCAR file: and LDA Na_sv and F PAW datasets. The OUTCAR file should now contain the following lines: Here the units "electrons Angst" denote {\displaystyle e\AA=-1.602 10^{-19}C\AA} {\displaystyle e\AA=-1.602 10^{-19}C\AA} . To calculate the change in the electronic polarization of NaF due to the displacement of the fluorine sublattice we repeat the previous calculation with the following POSCAR file: The OUTCAR should now contain something very similar to the following lines: From the above one easily recognizes that the change in the electronic dipole moment due to the F-sublattice displacement is: {\displaystyle \Delta\mathrm{p}=0.3606\hat{z}\;e\AA} {\displaystyle \Delta\mathrm{p}=0.3606\hat{z}\;e\AA} and the corresponding change in the ionic dipole moment: {\displaystyle \Delta\mathrm{p}=1.93939-2.25510=-0.31571\hat{z}\;e\AA} {\displaystyle \Delta\mathrm{p}=1.93939-2.25510=-0.31571\hat{z}\;e\AA} Thus the total change is found to be: {\displaystyle \Delta\mathrm{p}=0.36061-0.31571=0.0449\hat{z}\;e\AA} {\displaystyle \Delta\mathrm{p}=0.36061-0.31571=0.0449\hat{z}\;e\AA} and considering that the F-sublattice was displaced by 0.045102 Angstrom these calculations yield a Born effective charge for fluorine of {\displaystyle Z^*=0.0449/0.045102=-0.995|e|\;} {\displaystyle Z^*=0.0449/0.045102=-0.995|e|\;} . The socalled parallel or {\displaystyle \bold{G}_{\parallel}} {\displaystyle \bold{G}_{\parallel}} direction in the integration over the reciprocal space unit cell is set in IGPAR .
