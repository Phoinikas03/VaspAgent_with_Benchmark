ML_WTOTEN =  Description: Sets a scaling of the fitted potential energy. For ML_IWEIGHT =2 and 3 (default), the potential energy in the training data set is multiplied by ML_WTOTEN (unitless). We recommend increasing ML_WTOTEN if you plan to apply the force field in a simulation where the accuracy of the total energy is most important. This puts a focus on the energy error and is desirable, for instance, for the computation of defect-formation energies. For ML_IWEIGHT =1, ML_WTOTEN has the unit of eV/atom, and the potential energy in the training data set is divided by it.
