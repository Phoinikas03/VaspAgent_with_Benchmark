ML_W1 =  Default: ML_W1 = 0.1 Description: This tag defines the weight {\displaystyle \beta} {\displaystyle \beta} for the radial (and angular) descriptor within the machine learning force field method (see this section ). The weight for the angular descriptor {\displaystyle W_{2}} {\displaystyle W_{2}} is internally computed from the weight of the radial descriptor {\displaystyle W_{1}} {\displaystyle W_{1}} as: {\displaystyle W_{2}=1.0-W_{1}.} {\displaystyle W_{2}=1.0-W_{1}.} The value for ML_W1 must be chosen in the interval {\displaystyle } {\displaystyle } . By default, the angular and radial descriptors are both used although the latter is weighed less. In principle a weight of 0 for one of them is selectable which allows the code to internally skip the respective computation. However, it is generally recommended to use both descriptors to achieve satisfying training results.
