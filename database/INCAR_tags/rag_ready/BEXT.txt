BEXT =  (   ) Description: Specifies an external magnetic field in eV. BEXT tag sets an external magnetic field that acts on the electrons in a Zeeman-like manner. An additional potential of the following form carries this interaction: For spin-polarized calculations ( ISPIN = 2): For noncollinear calculations ( LNONCOLLINEAR = .TRUE.): The effect of the above is most easily understood for the collinear case ( ISPIN =2): The eigenenergies of spin-up states are raised by {\displaystyle B_{\rm ext}} {\displaystyle B_{\rm ext}} eV, whereas the eigenenergies of spin-down states are lowered by the same amount. The total energy changes by: where {\displaystyle n^{\uparrow}} {\displaystyle n^{\uparrow}} and {\displaystyle n^{\downarrow}} {\displaystyle n^{\downarrow}} are the number of up- and down-spin electrons in the system. BEXT is applied during the self-consistent electronic minimization and effectively shifts the eigenenergies of the spin-up and spin-down states w.r.t. each other at each step. Consequently, the electrons redistribute (changing the occupancies) and the density changes. The change in the density (,e.g., charge density and magnetization) also affects the scf potential and KS orbitals. For a rigid-band Zeeman splitting, converge the charge density with BEXT =0 and restart with BEXT {\displaystyle \neq} {\displaystyle \neq} 0 and fixed charge density ( ICHARG =11). Units For an applied magnetic field {\displaystyle B_0} {\displaystyle B_0} , the energy difference between two Zeeman-splitted electronic states is given by: where {\displaystyle \mu_B} {\displaystyle \mu_B} is the Bohr magneton and {\displaystyle g_e} {\displaystyle g_e} is the electron spin g -factor. For ISPIN =2, rigid-band Zeeman-splitted states imply: This leads to the following relationship between our definition of {\displaystyle B_{\rm ext}} {\displaystyle B_{\rm ext}} (in eV) and the magnetic field {\displaystyle B_0} {\displaystyle B_0} (in T): where {\displaystyle \mu_B} {\displaystyle \mu_B} = 5.788 381 8060 x 10 -5 eV T -1 , and {\displaystyle g_e} {\displaystyle g_e} = 2.002 319 304 362 56.
