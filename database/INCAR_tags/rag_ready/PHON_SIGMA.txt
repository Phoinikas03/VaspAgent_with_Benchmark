PHON_SIGMA =  Description: Set the width of the Gaussian function in eV to compute the phonon density of states. The density of states is computed between {\displaystyle } {\displaystyle } with {\displaystyle \omega_{\text{min}}} {\displaystyle \omega_{\text{min}}} and {\displaystyle \omega_{\text{max}}} {\displaystyle \omega_{\text{max}}} the lowest and highest phonon frequency and {\displaystyle \sigma} {\displaystyle \sigma} the broadening PHON_SIGMA . The number of energy points in this interval is set by PHON_NEDOS .
