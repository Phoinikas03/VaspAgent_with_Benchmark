PSUBSYS =  Description: PSUBSYS sets the collision probabilities for the atoms in each atomic subsystem in calculations with multiple Anderson thermostats (in case VASP was compiled with -Dtbdyn ). Up to three user-defined atomic subsystems may be coupled with independent Andersen thermostats  ( MDALGO =13). The collision probabilities for the atoms in each atomic subsystem is set by means of the PSUBSYS tag (one has to specify one number for each subsystem).
