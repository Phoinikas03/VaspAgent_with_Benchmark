LIBMBD_K_GRID =  Default: LIBMBD_K_GRID = determined in libMBD according to the cell shape Description: LIBMBD_K_GRID sets the k-mesh of the collective oscillations defined in the methods available in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . LIBMBD_K_GRID allows to choose the k-mesh of the collective oscillations defined in the methods available in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods. The three integers correspond to the number of k-points along the axes of the cell in the reciprocal space. The values are internally passed to the libMBD input k_grid described at the page  . libMBD is a separate library package that has to be downloaded  and compiled before VASP is compiled with the corresponding precompiler options and links to the libraries .
