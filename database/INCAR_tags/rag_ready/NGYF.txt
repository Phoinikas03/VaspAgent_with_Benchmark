NGYF =  Default: NGYF = set in accordance with PREC , NGY , ENCUT and ENAUG Description: NGYF sets the number of grid points in the "fine" FFT grid along the second lattice vector. On this "fine" FFT mesh the localized augmentation charges are represented if ultrasoft pseudopotentials (USPPs) or the PAW method are used. In case USPPs are used, the local potentials (exchange-correlation, Hartree-potential and ionic potentials) are also calculated on this "fine" FFT-mesh. By default NGYF is set in accordance with the requested "precision" mode PREC , NGY , and the plane wave kinetic energy cutoffs ENCUT and ENAUG : where with {\displaystyle E_{\rm cut}} {\displaystyle E_{\rm cut}} = ENCUT and {\displaystyle E_{\rm aug}} {\displaystyle E_{\rm aug}} = ENAUG . Alternatively, NGYF can be set to a specific value in the INCAR file. Related tags and articles NGX , NGY , NGZ , NGXF , NGZF , PREC , ENCUT , ENAUG Examples that use this tag
