PREC = Normal | Single | SingleN | Accurate | Low | Medium | High Description: PREC specifies the "precision" mode. PREC sets default values for the energy cutoff ENCUT , the FFT grids ( NGX , NGY , NGZ ) and ( NGXF , NGYF , NGZF ), and the accuracy of the projectors in real space ROPT (used only when LREAL =.TRUE.). Details are given below in the table. We recommend using PREC =Normal or PREC =Accurate. PREC =Normal can be used for most routine calculations. PREC =Accurate leads to a denser grid ( NGX , NGY , NGZ ). Thus, it reduces egg-box effects and strictly avoids any aliasing/wrap-around errors . PREC =Normal and PREC =Accurate use an augmentation fine grid ( NGXF , NGYF , NGZF ) that is twice larger than the grid ( NGX , NGY , NGZ ) used for the representation of the pseudo-orbitals. PREC =Accurate increases the memory requirements somewhat, but it should be used (in combination with an increased value for ENCUT ) when a very good accuracy is required, e.g., for accurate forces, for phonons and stress tensor or in general when second derivatives are computed. The accuracy of forces can also be sometimes further improved by specifying ADDGRID =.TRUE., however, reports from users are somewhat contradictory about whether this really helps. Default values set by PREC Default values set by PREC for the parameters ENCUT , ( NGX , NGY , NGZ ), ( NGXF , NGYF , NGZF ) and ROPT : where max( ENMAX ) and max( ENMIN ) are the maxima of ENMAX and ENMIN found in the POTCAR file, and {\displaystyle G_{\rm cut}} {\displaystyle G_{\rm cut}} and {\displaystyle G_{\rm aug}} {\displaystyle G_{\rm aug}} are defined by with {\displaystyle E_{\rm cut}} {\displaystyle E_{\rm cut}} = ENCUT and {\displaystyle E_{\rm aug}} {\displaystyle E_{\rm aug}} = ENAUG . Further remarks With PREC =Normal, Single, and Accurate the grid ( NGXF , NGYF , NGZF ) representing the augmentation charges, charge densities and potentials has either the same size ( PREC =Single) or the double size ( PREC =Normal or Accurate) as the grid ( NGX , NGY , NGZ ). With the deprecated (and no longer recommended) settings for PREC (Low, Medium and High), the grid ( NGXF , NGYF , NGZF ) is determined by some heuristic formula from ENAUG . PREC =Single uses the same grid ( NGX , NGY , NGZ ) as PREC =Normal in VASP.5, but the same grid as PREC =Accurate in VASP.6. However, the double grid technique is not used, i.e., ( NGXF , NGYF , NGZF )=( NGX , NGY , NGZ ). This is convenient if one needs to cut down on storage demands or if one wants to reduce the size of the files CHG and CHGCAR . Furthermore, PREC =Single avoids high-frequency oscillations caused by the double-grid technique and the resulting Fourier interpolation. It is often expedient for scanning tunneling simulations or other calculations where high-frequency wiggles of the charge density in the vacuum region are undesirable. PREC =Medium and PREC =Normal should usually be sufficiently accurate and lead to errors of less than 1 meV/atom. PREC =High should guarantee that the absolute energies are converged to a few meV and the stress tensor converged within a few kBar.
