LKPROJ = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LKPROJ = .FALSE. Description: switches on the k -point projection scheme. For LKPROJ =.TRUE., VASP will project the orbitals onto the reciprocal space of an alternative unit cell. This unit cell has to be supplied in the file POSCAR.prim , in the usual POSCAR format. As a first step, the k -projection scheme determines the set { k′ }, of k -points in the irreducible part of the first Brillouin zone of the structure given in POSCAR.prim , for which where G and G′ are reciprocal space vectors in the reciprocal spaces of the structures specified in POSCAR and POSCAR.prim , respectively. As usual, the set of points { k } is specified in the KPOINTS file. The set { k′ } is written to the OUTCAR file. Look at the part of the OUTCAR following NKPTS_PRIM . Once the set { k′ } has been determined VASP will compute the following and writes this information onto the PRJCAR and vasprun.xml files. K n k sigma k′ provides a measure of how strongly the orbital {\displaystyle \Psi} {\displaystyle \Psi} n k sigma contributes at the point k′ in the reciprocal space of structure POSCAR.prim . One may, for instance, use this scheme to project the orbitals of a supercell onto the reciprocal space of a generating primitive cell. Related tags and articles PRJCAR Examples that use this tag
