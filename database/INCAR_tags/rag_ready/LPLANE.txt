LPLANE =  Default: LPLANE = .TRUE. Description: LPLANE switches on the plane-wise data distribution in real space. For LPLANE =.TRUE., the data distribution in real space is done plane wise. Any combination of NPAR and LPLANE can be used. Generally, LPLANE =.TRUE. reduces the communication band width during the FFT's, but at the same time it unfortunately worsens the load balancing on massively parallel machines. LPLANE =.TRUE. should only be used if NGZ is at least 3x(number of nodes)/ NPAR , and optimal load balancing is achieved if NGZ = n x NPAR , where n is an arbitrary integer. If LPLANE =.TRUE. and if the real space projector functions ( LREAL =.TRUE. or ON or AUTO) are used, it might be necessary to check the lines following The max/ min values should not differ too much, otherwise the load balancing might worsen as well. The optimum settings for NPAR and LPLANE depend strongly on the type of machine you are using. Some recommended setups: LINUX cluster linked by Infiniband, modern multicore machines: LINUX cluster linked by 1 Gbit Ethernet, and LINUX clusters with single cores: Massively parallel machines (Cray, Blue Gene): Related tags and articles NPAR , NCORE , LSCALU , NSIM , KPAR , LSCALAPACK , LSCAAWARE Examples that use this tag
