LSFBXC = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LSFBXC = .FALSE. Description: Removes sources and drains from the exchange-correlation B field. With LSFBXC =T, the sources and drains are removed from the exchange-correlation (XC) B field  at each step of the electronic minimization. Thus, any XC potential can be constrained to correspond to a Maxwellian magnetic field at the cost of becoming a potential-only XC functional , since there is no correction applied to the XC energy. Moore et al. implemented the same feature in a parallel work   and performed more extensive applications. Whether the two implementations are identical has not been tested, and no publication is associated with the present implementation (by Marie-Therese Huebsch) using LSFBXC .
