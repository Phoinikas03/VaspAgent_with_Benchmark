IDIPOL = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 Description: IDIPOL switches on monopole/dipole and quadrupole corrections to the total energy in a specific direction (1-3) or all directions (4) IDIPOL = 1-3 The dipole moment will be calculated only parallel to the direction of the first, second or third lattice vector, respectively. The corrections for the total energy are calculated as the energy difference between a monopole/dipole and quadrupole in the current supercell and the same dipole placed in a super cell with the corresponding lattice vector approaching infinity. IDIPOL = 4 For IDIPOL =4 the full dipole moment in all directions will be calculated, and the corrections to the total energy are calculated as the energy difference between a monopole/dipole/quadrupole in the current supercell and the same monopole/dipole/quadrupole placed in a vacuum. Note : strictly speaking quadrupole corrections is not the proper wording.
