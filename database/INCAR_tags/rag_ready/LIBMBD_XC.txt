LIBMBD_XC = pbe | pbe0 | hse | blyp | b3lyp | revpbe | am05 | none Default: The functional set by the GGA , METAGGA or XC tag Description: LIBMBD_XC sets the exchange-correlation functional for the setting of damping parameters used in the methods available in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . LIBMBD_XC allows to choose the exchange-correlation functional that determines which set of damping parameters is used in the methods available in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods. The value is internally passed to the libMBD input xc described at the page  . The possible choices depend on the dispersion method selected with the LIBMBD_METHOD tag and are listed in the file mbd_damping.F90 of the libMBD source code. If LIBMBD_XC =none is chosen, then no set of damping parameters is selected and either LIBMBD_TS_SR or LIBMBD_MBD_BETA has to be set. libMBD is a separate library package that has to be downloaded  and compiled before VASP is compiled with the corresponding precompiler options and links to the libraries .
