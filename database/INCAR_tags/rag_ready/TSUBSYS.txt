TSUBSYS =  Description: TSUBSYS sets the temperatures for the atomic subsystems in calculations with multiple Anderson thermostats (in case VASP was compiled with -Dtbdyn ). Up to three user-defined atomic subsystems may be coupled with independent Andersen thermostats  ( MDALGO =13). The simulation temperature for the atomic subsystems is set by means of the TSUBSYS tag (one has to specify one number for each subsystem).
