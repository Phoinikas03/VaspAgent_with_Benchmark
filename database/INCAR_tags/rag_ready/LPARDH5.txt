LPARDH5 =  Default: LPARDH5 = .FALSE. Description: LPARDH5 determines whether the partial charges are written to PARCHG or vaspout.h5 . Partial charges can be calculated as a postprocessing step when LPARD = .TRUE.. The output is written to one or several PARCHG files if LPARDH5 =.FALSE., and to vaspout.h5 if LPARDH5 =.TRUE.. If NBMOD = -1, the setting of LPARD is irrelevant. Instead of a PARCHG file, or a partial_charges group in the vaspout.h5 hdf5 file, a CHGCAR file without augmentation charges will be written. If the output is redirected to vaspout.h5 , py4vasp can be used to analyze the partial charge density and to simulate STM pictures.
