LIBMBD_TS_SR =  Default: LIBMBD_TS_SR = value that was determined for the exchange-correlation functional set with LIBMBD_XC Description: LIBMBD_TS_SR sets the value of the scaling factor {\displaystyle s_R} {\displaystyle s_R} in the Tkatchenko-Scheffler method  as implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . LIBMBD_TS_SR allows to choose the value of the scaling factor {\displaystyle s_R} {\displaystyle s_R} in the Tkatchenko-Scheffler method  as implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . The value is internally passed to the libMBD input ts_sr described at the page  . LIBMBD_TS_SR is similar to the VDW_SR tag that is used for the VASP implementation of the Tkatchenko-Scheffler method. libMBD is a separate library package that has to be downloaded  and compiled before VASP is compiled with the corresponding precompiler options and links to the libraries .
