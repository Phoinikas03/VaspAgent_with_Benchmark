IPEAD = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 Default: IPEAD = 4 Description: IPEAD specifies the order of the finite difference stencil used to compute the derivative of the cell-periodic part of the orbitals w.r.t. k , |grad k u n k ⟩ ( LPEAD =.TRUE.), and the derivative of the polarization w.r.t. the orbitals, delta P /delta⟨ψ n k | for ( LCALCEPS =.TRUE., or EFIELD_PEAD != 0 ). A central finite differences formula or order IPEAD is used to compute the first-order derivative of the cell-periodic part of the orbitals w.r.t. k . The coefficients for the different orders can be found here . Related tags and articles LPEAD , LCALCEPS , EFIELD_PEAD , Berry phases and finite electric fields Examples that use this tag
