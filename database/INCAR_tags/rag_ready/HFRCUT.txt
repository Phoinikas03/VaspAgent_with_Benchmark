HFRCUT =  Default: HFRCUT = 0 Description: HFRCUT specifies how the Coulomb kernel is approximated at G=0 when the Fock energy and the exchange potential are evaluated. In systems with periodic boundary conditions, the Coulomb energy and the Coulomb potential are usually evaluated under the assumption of a compensating background by introducing a compensation charge density. This is well-justified for the Hartree energy, where the compensation charge density stems from the ions. Yet, this assumption is not valid for the Fock exchange, which causes an error. For the Fock exchange potential and energy, one can correct the resulting error by assuming that the density matrix is local. The leading order correction is given by the difference between the electrostatic energy of a localized model charge density in a homogeneous background periodically repeated and the same model charge density in isolation. For details we refer to J. Paier et al.,  Section II. D. 4. HFRCUT = 0: Ewald summation or method of Massida, Posternak, and Baldereschi depending on k-mesh   HFRCUT = -1: Automated cutoff radius  HFRCUT = : Manually set cutoff radius in Angstromngström. In the limit of many k-points, both methods ( HFRCUT =-1 and HFRCUT =0) should yield identical results. In our experience, the HFRCUT =-1 converges more rapidly for systems with a gap, as well as molecules and atoms, whereas HFRCUT =0 converges faster for metallic systems. It is expedient to first converge the energies with respect to the number of k-points for both methods and then select for subsequent calculations the method that converges more rapidly. A detailed comparison of the convergence of the different methods for metallic and gapped materials was made by Sundararaman and Arias  .
