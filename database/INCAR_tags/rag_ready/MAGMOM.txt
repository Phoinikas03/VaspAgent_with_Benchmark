MAGMOM =  Description: Initial magnetic moment for each atom if no magnetization density is present. Considered when symmetry is determined. For a magnetic calculation from scratch ( ISTART =0), MAGMOM specifies (i) the initial on-site magnetic moment for each atom, and (ii) lowers the symmetry of the system (as of VASP.4.4.4). A magnetic calculation could be either a spin-polarized calculation ( ISPIN =2) or noncollinear calculation ( LNONCOLLINEAR =T). If the MAGMOM line breaks a symmetry of the crystal, the corresponding symmetry operation is removed and not applied during the symmetrization of, e.g., charges and forces. When restarting a magnetic calculation , MAGMOM is only used to determine the symmetry of the system and not to set the on-site magnetic moment. Therefore, if you remove the MAGMOM tag before restarting from a converged WAVECAR or CHGCAR , the magnetization is likely to be symmetrized away. MAGMOM also specifies the initial on-site magnetic moments when a magnetic calculation ( ISPIN =2 or LNONCOLLINEAR =T) is started from a non-spin-polarized calculation ( ISPIN =1 and LNONCOLLINEAR =F). This implies restarting with ICHARG =1 while the CHGCAR file contains no magnetization density. Starting magnetic calculations from a non-spin-polarized calculation can improve convergence. The I_CONSTRAINED_M tag can constrain the on-site magnetic moments. Format and basis For a spin-polarized calculation ( ISPIN =2), MAGMOM is a list of NIONS positive or negative values that specify the magnitude and relative orientation of the magnetization on each ion. The on-site magnetic moments have no direction in real space, i.e., no orientation in the lattice. For noncollinear calculation ( LNONCOLLINEAR =T), the on-site magnetic moment is specified by three components for each ion. Without spin-orbit coupling ( LSORBIT =False), the total energy depends only on the relative direction of the on-site magnetic moments. Hence, you can give the desired magnetic structure in Cartesian coordinates without considering how the lattice matrix or SAXIS is defined. With spin-orbit coupling ( LSORBIT =True), the three components must be specified in the basis of spinor space that is defined by SAXIS . The default is {\displaystyle \sigma_1=\hat x} {\displaystyle \sigma_1=\hat x} , {\displaystyle \sigma_2 =\hat y} {\displaystyle \sigma_2 =\hat y} , {\displaystyle \sigma_3 = \hat z} {\displaystyle \sigma_3 = \hat z} , such that MAGMOM can be given in Cartesian coordinates. The orientation of MAGMOM with respect to the lattice only matters if spin-orbit coupling is included ( LSORBIT ). Examples The most simple input for a bcc cell with antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin alignment would be the following. If you have problems converging to a desired magnetic solution, try to calculate first the non-magnetic ground state and continue from the generated WAVECAR and CHGCAR . To restart, e.g., a calculation with two atoms that have equally large and antiferromagnetically coupled on-site magnetic moments, you need to set the following in the INCAR file: For systems containing many atoms, MAGMOM input on a single line can be hard to read, especially in the noncollinear case. It is possible to provide INCAR input on multiple lines using backslashes ( \ ) as linebreaks. E.g. for a noncollinear system with AFM alignment and 16 atoms (the first 8 of them magnetic), the multi-line input could look like this: Related Tags and Sections ISPIN , LNONCOLLINEAR , LSORBIT , SAXIS , LORBIT , I_CONSTRAINED_M Examples that use this tag
