LDAU = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LDAU = .FALSE. Description: LDAU =.TRUE. switches on DFT+U. Note on bandstructure calculation : The CHGCAR file contains only information up to angular momentum quantum number {\displaystyle l} {\displaystyle l} = LMAXMIX for the on-site PAW occupancy matrices . When the CHGCAR file is read and kept fixed in the course of the calculations ( ICHARG =11), the results will be necessarily not identical to a self-consistent run. The deviations are often large for DFT+U calculations. For the calculation of band structures within the DFT+U approach, it is hence strictly required to increase LMAXMIX to 4 ( {\displaystyle d} {\displaystyle d} elements) and 6 ( {\displaystyle f} {\displaystyle f} elements).
