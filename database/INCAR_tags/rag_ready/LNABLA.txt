LNABLA = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LNABLA = .FALSE. Description: LNABLA =.TRUE. evaluates the transversal expression for the frequency dependent dielectric matrix. Usually VASP uses the longitudinal expression for the frequency dependent dielectric matrix . It is however possible to switch to the computationally somewhat simpler transversal expressions by selecting LNABLA =.TRUE. (Eqs. 17 and 20 in Ref.  ). In this simplification the imaginary part of the macroscopic dielectric function is given by Except for the purpose of testing, there is however hardly ever a reason to use the transversal expression, since it is less accurate.
