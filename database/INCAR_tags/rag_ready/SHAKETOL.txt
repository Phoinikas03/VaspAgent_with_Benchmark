SHAKETOL =  Default: SHAKETOL = {\displaystyle 10^{-5}} {\displaystyle 10^{-5}} Description: SHAKETOL specifies the tolerance for the SHAKE algorithm (in case VASP was compiled with -Dtbdyn ). Constrained molecular dynamics ( MDALGO =1 | 2) are performed using a SHAKE algorithm .  SHAKETOL specifies the tolerance for the SHAKE algorithm. If the error for all geometric constraints does not decrease below this predefined tolerance within the allowed number of iterations ( SHAKEMAXITER ), VASP terminates with an error message.
