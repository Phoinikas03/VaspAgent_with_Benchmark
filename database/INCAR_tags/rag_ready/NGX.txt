NGX =  Default: NGX = set in accordance with PREC and ENCUT Description: NGX sets the number of grid points in the FFT grid along the first lattice vector. By default NGX is set in accordance with the requested "precision" mode PREC and the plane wave kinetic energy cutoff ENCUT : where with {\displaystyle E_{\rm cut}} {\displaystyle E_{\rm cut}} = ENCUT . Alternatively, NGX can be set to a specific value in the INCAR file. Related tags and articles NGY , NGZ , NGXF , NGYF , NGZF , PREC , ENCUT , ENAUG Examples that use this tag
