SCALEE =  Default: SCALEE = 1 Description: This tag specifies the coupling parameter of the energies and forces between a fully interacting system and a reference system. The tag SCALEE sets the coupling parameter {\displaystyle \lambda} {\displaystyle \lambda} and hence controls the Hamiltonian of the calculation. By default SCALEE =1 and the scaling of the energies and forces via the coupling constant is internally skipped in the code. To enable the scaling SCALEE {\displaystyle \ne} {\displaystyle \ne} 1 has to be specified. More information using this tag is given here .
