EDIFFG =  Default: EDIFFG = EDIFF x10 Description: EDIFFG defines the break condition for the ionic relaxation loop. When EDIFFG is positive, the relaxation is stopped when the change of the total energy is smaller than EDIFFG between two ionic steps. When EDIFFG is negative, the relaxation is stopped when the norms of all the forces are smaller than | EDIFFG |. This is usually a more convenient setting. If EDIFFG = 0, the ionic relaxation is stopped after NSW steps. Related tags and articles EDIFF Examples that use this tag
