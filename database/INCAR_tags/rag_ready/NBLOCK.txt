NBLOCK =  Default: NBLOCK = 1 Description: After NBLOCK ionic steps the pair-correlation function and the DOS are calculated and the ionic configuration is written to the XDATCAR -file. It is recommended to leave NBLOCK to 1, since the computational overhead to determine the DOS and pair correlation function is minimal. Only for molecular dynamics simulations with many 1000 steps or when using machine-learned force fields, it might be expedient to increase NBLOCK to say 10 or even 100, to avoid large XDATCAR -files and the evaluation of the pair correlation function at every step. In addition NBLOCK controls how often the kinetic energy is scaled if SMASS = -1 . After KBLOCK * NBLOCK ionic steps the averaged pair correlation function and DOS are written to the files PCDAT and DOSCAR . The internal accumulators are reset, and after another KBLOCK * NBLOCK steps the new averaged quantities are written out.
