HILLS_H =  Default: HILLS_H = {\displaystyle 10^{-3}} {\displaystyle 10^{-3}} Description: HILLS_H specifies the height of the Gaussian hill (in eV) used in metadynamics (in case VASP was compiled with -Dtbdyn ). In metadynamics ( MDALGO =11 | 21), the bias potential is given as Thre parameters ( HILLS_H , HILLS_W , and HILLS_BIN ) must be provided by the user. The height of the Gaussian hills {\displaystyle h} {\displaystyle h} (in eV) is set by HILLS_H .
