NFREE =  Description: depending on IBRION , NFREE specifies the number of remembered steps in the history of ionic convergence runs, or the number of ionic displacements in frozen phonon calculations. IBRION =1 (quasi-Newton algorithm for ionic relaxation): IBRION =5 (from VASP.4.5) or IBRION =6 (from VASP.5.1): frozen phonon approach to calculate the zone-center vibrational frequencies of a system.
