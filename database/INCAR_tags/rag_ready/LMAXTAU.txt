LMAXTAU =  Description: LMAXTAU is the maximum l -quantum number included in the PAW one-center expansion of the kinetic energy density. The PAW one-center expansion of the density has component up to and including L =2* l max , where l max is the l -quantum number of the partial waves on the POTCAR file, with the highest angular moment. If the PAW one-center expansion of the density has component up to L , then the one-center expansion of the kinetic energy density has components up to L +2. This means that as a rule of thumb, for s -elements: LMAXTAU =2, for p : LMAXTAU =4, and for d : LMAXTAU =6. If you are willing to live with the computational costs, the default for LMAXTAU should be safe in all cases, except those involving f -elements.
