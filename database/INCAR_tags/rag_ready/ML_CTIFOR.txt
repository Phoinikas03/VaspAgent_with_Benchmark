Description: This flag sets the threshold for the error estimation in the machine learning force field method. The use of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: here . Generally, first principles calculations are only performed if the error estimate of one force exceeds the threshold. The initial threshold is set to the value provided by the tag ML_CTIFOR (units of eV/Angstrom for ML_CALGO =0 and unitless for ML_CALGO =1). For ML_CALGO =0, the threshold can be updated dynamically during ML. The details of the update are controlled by ML_ICRITERIA . Typically, after extensive training, attainable values for ML_CTIFOR are 0.02 around 300-500 K, and 0.06 around 1000-2000 K, so temperature but also system dependent. The initial default 0.002 is only sensible, if ML_CTIFOR is automatically updated ( ML_ICRITERIA = 1 or 2). If ML_ICRITERIA = 0 is used, it is necessary to use significantly larger values around 0.02-0.06 for ML_CTIFOR . For ML_CALGO =1, only a constant threshold during the calculation is available ( ML_ICRITERIA =0). The related tag ML_SCLC_CTIFOR determines how many local reference configurations are chosen from each first principles calculations.
