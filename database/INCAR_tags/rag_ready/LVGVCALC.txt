LVGVCALC = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LVGVCALC = .TRUE. Description: LVGVCALC switches on calculation of the vGv expression for the orbital magnetic susceptibility. LVGVCALC is available as of VASP.6.4.0. When performing a chemical shift calculation the standard pGv susceptibility is calculated and used in the calculation of the CSA tensor  . When LVGVCALC is true, the magnetic susceptibility is also calculated with the vGv approximation. LVGVAPPL determines whether the vGv or pGv result is applied in the calculation of the {\displaystyle \mathbf{G=0}} {\displaystyle \mathbf{G=0}} contribution to the CSA tensor. The vGv expression for the orbital susceptibility was introduced by d'Avezac et al.  . In VASP its ultra-soft generalization is used  . Related tags and articles LCHIMAG , LVGVAPPL References
