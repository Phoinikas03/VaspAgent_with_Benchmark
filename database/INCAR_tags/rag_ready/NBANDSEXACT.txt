NBANDSEXACT =  Description: NBANDSEXACT specifies the number of bands used in the all-in-one mode of many-body perturbation theory calculations. In the all-in-one mode, VASP automatically performs the necessary DFT steps prior to the many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculation, i.e. a DFT calculation with NBANDS , followed by an exact diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian with NBANDSEXACT bands. Note, NBANDSEXACT is set by default to the maximum number of plane-waves given by the chosen energy cutoff for the orbitals ENCUT . In the all-in-one mode, the actual GW/RPA calculation is also performed with NBANDSEXACT bands. If NBANDS_WAVE is not set, all orbitals are written to WAVECAR , which potentially becomes huge in file size. The all-in-one mode is automatically enabled for ALGO =GWR, RPA,ACFDT if NBANDS is not set. Related tags and articles ALGO , NBANDS NBANDS_WAVE LALL_IN_ONE IALL_IN_ONE
