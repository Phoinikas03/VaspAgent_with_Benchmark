NOMEGA_DUMP =  Description: NOMEGA_DUMP selects the imaginary frequency point of screened potential in low-scaling GW calculations that is written to file. NOMEGA_DUMP selects the imaginary frequency point of the screened Coulomb kernel that is written to WFULLxxxx.tmp in low-scaling GW calculations . If set to 0, WFULLxxxx.tmp contains the screened Coulomb interaction W at {\displaystyle \omega=0} {\displaystyle \omega=0} . For positive values, these files contain the screened Coulomb interaction at the corresponding imaginary frequency point. For negative values, WFULLxxxx.tmp is not written.
