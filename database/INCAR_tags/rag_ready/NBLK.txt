NBLK =  Description: NBLK determines the blocking factor in many BLAS level 3 routines. In some cases, VASP has to perform a unitary transformation of the current orbitals. This is done using a work array CBLOCK and the following FORTRAN code: ZGEMM is the matrix {\displaystyle \times} {\displaystyle \times} matrix multiplication command of the BLAS package. The task performed by this call is indicated by the comment line written above the ZGEMM call. Generally NBLK =16 or 32 is large enough for super-scalar machines. A large value might be necessary on vector machines for optimal performance ( NBLK =128). Examples that use this tag
