LWRITE_UNK = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LWRITE_UNK = .FALSE. Description: LWRITE_UNK decides whether the cell-periodic part of the relevant Bloch functions is written. For LWRITE_UNK =True, VASP writes the cell-periodic part of the Kohn–Sham orbitals in spin channel s at k point p to the file wannier90.UNKp.s . This file can be used to plot Wannier orbitals with WANNIER90. For details on the execution of wannier_setup in VASP, see the description of the LWANNIER90 tag. For information on the wannier90.win file and the execution of WANNIER90, we refer to the WANNIER90 manual . Related tags and articles LWANNIER90 , LWRITE_MMN_AMN Examples that use this tag
