SMEARINGS =  Default: SMEARINGS = not set Description: SMEARINGS defines the smearing parameters for ISMEAR = -3 in the calculation of the partial occupancies. ISMEAR = -3 performs a loop over smearing-parameters supplied in the INCAR file. With the tag SMEARINGS , you select which smearings are used VASP will then read the provided smearings and conduct ( NSW + 1) calculations with the different smearings. For the first calculation, VASP uses tetrahedron smearing ISMEAR = -5 to ensure that the tetrahedron information is present in case any of the selected smearings uses a tetrahedron method. Since VASP uses the relaxation engine to loop over the different smearings you cannot combine SMEARINGS with other relaxation methods IBRION .
