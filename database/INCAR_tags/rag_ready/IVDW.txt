IVDW = 1 | 11 | 12 | 2 | 21 | ... Default: IVDW = 0 (no correction) Description: IVDW specifies a vdW dispersion term of the atom-pairwise or many-body type. Available vdW atom-pairwise and many-body methods With all methods listed below, a dispersion correction is added to the total energy, but also to the atomic forces and stress tensor, such that lattice relaxations, molecular dynamics, and vibrational analysis (via finite differences) can be performed. Note, however, that these correction schemes are currently not available for phonon calculations based on density functional perturbation theory .
