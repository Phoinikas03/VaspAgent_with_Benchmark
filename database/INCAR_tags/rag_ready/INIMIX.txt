INIMIX = 0 | 1 | 2 Default: INIMIX = 1 Description: Determines the functional form of the initial mixing matrix in the Broyden scheme ( IMIX =4). The initial mixing matrix might influence the convergence speed for complex situations (especially surfaces and magnetic systems), nevertheless INIMIX must not be changed from the default setting: anything which can be done with INIMIX can also be done with AMIX and BMIX , and changing AMIX and BMIX is definitely preferable. Possible choices for INIMIX are: INIMIX =0 INIMIX =1 INIMIX =2 Related tags and articles IMIX , MAXMIX , AMIX , BMIX , AMIX_MAG , BMIX_MAG , AMIN , MIXPRE , WC Examples that use this tag
