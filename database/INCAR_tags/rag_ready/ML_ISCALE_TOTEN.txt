ML_ISCALE_TOTEN =  Default: ML_ISCALE_TOTEN = 2 Description: This tag specifies how to scale the energy data in the machine learning force field method. The following cases are possible: ML_ISCALE_TOTEN = 1 : The total energy is scaled to the total energy of the isolated atoms given by ML_EATOM_REF . ML_ISCALE_TOTEN = 2 : The total energy is scaled to the average of the training data. This is the default setting. Related tags and articles ML_LMLFF , ML_EATOM_REF Examples that use this tag
