LSCDM = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Description: LSCDM switches on the selected columns of the density matrix (SCDM) method. The selected columns of the density matrix (SCDM) method works by fitting a unitary matrix {\displaystyle U_{mn\mathbf{k}}} {\displaystyle U_{mn\mathbf{k}}} that transforms the basis from Bloch states {\displaystyle |\psi_{n\mathbf{k}}\rangle} {\displaystyle |\psi_{n\mathbf{k}}\rangle} obtained by VASP to a Wannier basis {\displaystyle |w_{m\mathbf{R}}\rangle} {\displaystyle |w_{m\mathbf{R}}\rangle} . This is done using a one-shot method through a singular-value decomposition as proposed by A. Damle and L. Lin  . In order to obtain a good Wannierization, a certain level of freedom should be given to the localized orbitals to adequately accommodate the Bloch states. This is controlled by the cutoff function specified by the CUTOFF_TYPE tag and related parameters {\displaystyle \mu} {\displaystyle \mu} ( CUTOFF_MU ) and {\displaystyle \sigma} {\displaystyle \sigma} ( CUTOFF_SIGMA ).
