CLZ =  Description: CLZ selects a fractional or the full electron charge for the core hole in the core-excitation calculations with ICORELEVEL =2. In SCH CLZ can be used to introduce a fraction of the core hole. For example, a half-core hole can be created to simulate a transition state in the X-ray excitation process.
