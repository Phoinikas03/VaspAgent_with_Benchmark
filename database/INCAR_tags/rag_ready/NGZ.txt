NGZ =  Default: NGZ = set in accordance with PREC and ENCUT Description: NGZ sets the number of grid points in the FFT grid along the third lattice vector. By default NGZ is set in accordance with the requested "precision" mode PREC and the plane wave kinetic energy cutoff ENCUT : where with {\displaystyle E_{\rm cut}} {\displaystyle E_{\rm cut}} = ENCUT . Alternatively, NGZ can be set to a specific value in the INCAR file. Related tags and articles NGX , NGY , NGXF , NGYF , NGZF , PREC , ENCUT , ENAUG Examples that use this tag
