PLUGINS/OCCUPANCIES = .True. | .False. Default: PLUGINS/OCCUPANCIES = .False. Description: PLUGINS/OCCUPANCIES calls the Python plugin for the occupancies interface for each ionic relaxation step When PLUGINS/OCCUPANCIES =.TRUE., VASP calls the occupancies Python function at the end of each ionic relaxation step. The primary use-case of this tag to recompute the occupancies after performing modifications through other plugins such as PLUGINS/LOCAL_POTENTIAL . It also allows changing NELECT , EFERMI , NUPDOWN , ISMEAR , SIGMA , EMIN and EMAX at the end of each SCF step, to be reflected in the next step. Expected inputs The occupancies Python function expects the following inputs, where constants and additions and Python dataclasses . The constants dataclass consists of the following inputs, listed here with their associated datatypes The additions dataclass consists of the same quantities as the constants tag. Modifying quantities Modify the quantities listed in additions by adding to them.
