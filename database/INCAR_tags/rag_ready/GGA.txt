GGA = PE | RP | PS | AM | LIBXC | ... Default: The functional specified by LEXCH in the POTCAR if METAGGA and XC are also not specified. Description: Selects a LDA or GGA exchange-correlation functional . Available functionals This table lists the LDA and GGA functionals available in VASP. The names of functionals which end with "_X" and "_C" correspond to exchange-only and correlation functionals, respectively. (1) The Slater LDA exchange includes relativistic effects.  (2) The exchange component was designed in particular to be used as the exchange component of Nonlocal vdW-DF functionals and with AGGAC =0 such that only LDA is used for the local correlation, see list of nonlocal vdW-DF functionals .
