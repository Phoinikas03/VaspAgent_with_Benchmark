NBANDSGW =  Default: NBANDSGW = twice the number of occupied states Description: The flag determines how many QP energies are calculated and updated in GW type calculations. This value usually needs to be increased somewhat for partially or fully self-consistent calculations. Very accurate results are only obtained when NBANDSGW approaches NBANDS , although this dramatically increases the computational requirements.
