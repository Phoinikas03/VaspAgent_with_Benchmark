LHYPERFINE = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LHYPERFINE = .FALSE. Description: compute the hyperfine tensors at the atomic sites (available as of vasp.5.3.2). To have VASP compute the hyperfine tensors at the atomic sites, set The hyperfine tensor A I describes the interaction between a nuclear spin S I (located at site R I ) and the electronic spin distribution S e (in most cases associated with a paramagnetic defect state)  : In general it is written as the sum of an isotropic part, the so-called Fermi contact term, and an anisotropic (dipolar) part. The Fermi contact term is given by where rho s is the spin density, μ 0 is the magnetic susceptibility of free space, gamma e the electron gyromagnetic ratio, gamma I the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus at R I , and {\displaystyle \langle S_z \rangle} {\displaystyle \langle S_z \rangle} the expectation value of the z -component of the total electronic spin. delta T ( r ) is a smeared out delta function, as described in the Appendix of Ref.  . The dipolar contributions to the hyperfine tensor are given by In the equations above r =| r |, r i the i-th component of r , and r is taken relative to the position of the nucleus R I . The nuclear gyromagnetic ratios should be specified by means of the NGYROMAG -tag: where one should specify one number for each of the N species on the POSCAR file, i.e. if C, H, N, and O are listed as species in the POSCAR file, then there should be four numbers in NGYROMAG , regardless of how many total atoms there are. Input An example INCAR is presented below used for a Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond: Change the values of NGYROMAG to your corresponding system. LASPH is commented out. For crystals, it is not generally important; however, for molecules, it is very important. Output As usual, all output is written to the OUTCAR file. VASP writes three blocks of data. The first is for the Fermi contact coupling parameter: with an entry for each ion on the POSCAR file. A pw , A 1PS , A 1AE , and A 1c are the plane wave, pseudo one-center, all-electron one-center, and one-center core contributions to the Fermi contact term, respectively. The total Fermi contact term is given by A tot . The dipolar contributions are listed next: Again one line per ion in the POSCAR file. The total hyperfine tensors are written as: i.e., the tensors have been diagonalized and rearranged. Units The Fermi contact term {\displaystyle A} {\displaystyle A} is measured in following units {\displaystyle = \left\times \left\times \left\times \left = \frac{T^2m^3}{J}\times \frac{J}{T}\times \frac{MHz}{T}\times \frac{1}{m^3} = MHz } {\displaystyle = \left\times \left\times \left\times \left = \frac{T^2m^3}{J}\times \frac{J}{T}\times \frac{MHz}{T}\times \frac{1}{m^3} = MHz } with {\displaystyle \mu_0=4\pi\times 10^{-7} T^2 m^3 J^{-1}} {\displaystyle \mu_0=4\pi\times 10^{-7} T^2 m^3 J^{-1}} , {\displaystyle g_e\mu_e=9.28476377\times 10^{-24} J T^{-1}, |\psi(0)|^2=10^{30}m^{-3}} {\displaystyle g_e\mu_e=9.28476377\times 10^{-24} J T^{-1}, |\psi(0)|^2=10^{30}m^{-3}} . NGYROMAG is given in units of MHz/T. Advice PAW pseudopotentials Choice of PAW potentials : The hyperfine coupling parameter can be sensitive to the specific PAW potential used, as different pseudopotentials include a varying number of electrons in the valence (i.e. _sv, _pv). It is important to match the all-electron (AE) wavefunction. GW pseudopotentials (i.e. _GW) often offer a better description than standard potentials. Core contributions and hybrid functionals Make sure to include core contributions when reporting Fermi contact terms  . These are very important and their inclusion improves comparison to experiment  . The use of hybrid functionals can also improve the hyperfine coupling constants when compared to experiment. E.g., for defects in silicon, HSE06 localizes the defect relative to PBE, significantly improving the description  . Input parameters We recommend using tightly converged settings: Additionally, we recommend performing convergence tests with respect to the plane-wave energy cutoff ENCUT and k-point mesh KPOINTS to ensure convergence has been achieved for your system. Convergence is generally quick with respect to energy cutoff. Convergence can be very dependent on k-point mesh density. In some cases, e.g. if your cell is too small, then increasing the k-point mesh can result in convergence to a non-magnetic solution, eliminating the hyperfine coupling. Test your system with LASPH = .TRUE. and .FALSE. In some cases, non-spherical contributions may be important. Converging to non-magnetic states It is possible that your system relaxes to a non-magnetic solution, causing the hyperfine splitting to disappear (i.e. all zeros). If you think your system should be magnetic, you can enforce it using NUPDOWN , which will return the hyperfine splitting, cf. forum post: https://vasp.at/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16921 . NUPDOWN will change the Total magnetic moment S= at the start of the hyperfine coupling section in the OUTCAR . Related tags and articles NGYROMAG Examples that use this tag References
