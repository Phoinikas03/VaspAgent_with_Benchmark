ML_LMLFF =  Default: ML_LMLFF = .FALSE. Description: Main control tag which enables/disables the use of machine learning force fields. If ML_LMLFF = .FALSE. machine learning force fields are disabled and all related INCAR tags, i.e. all tags starting with " ML_ ", are ignored. If machine learning force fields are used by setting ML_LMLFF = .TRUE., the VASP mode of operation depends on the choice of ML_MODE . If ML_MODE is not supplied in the INCAR file then the default mode of operation is to run an MD simulation with on-the-fly machine learning, i.e., ML_MODE . This training is started "from scratch" if no ML_AB file is provided, otherwise a continuation run is performed.
