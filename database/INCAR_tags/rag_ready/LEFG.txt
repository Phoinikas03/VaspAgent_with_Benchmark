LEFG = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LEFG = .FALSE. Description: The LEFG computes the electric field gradient (EFG) at positions of the atomic nuclei. For LEFG =.TRUE., the electric field gradient tensors at the positions of the atomic nuclei are calculated using the method of Petrilli et al.  . The EFG tensors are symmetric. The principal components V ii and asymmetry parameter η are printed for each atom. Following convention the principal components V ii are ordered such that: The asymmetry parameter is defined as {\displaystyle \eta = {(V_{yy} - V_{xx})}/ V_{zz}} {\displaystyle \eta = {(V_{yy} - V_{xx})}/ V_{zz}} . For so-called "quadrupolar nuclei", i.e. , nuclei with nuclear spin I>1/2, NMR experiments can access V zz and η. To convert the V zz values into the C q often encountered in NMR literature, one has to specify the nuclear quadrupole moment by means of the QUAD_EFG -tag. Recommendations and advice Tight settings are required for calculating the electric field gradient. Input parameters A larger ENCUT value than usual, generally much higher than the value given by ENMAX in the POTCAR file, e.g. 800 eV for C in diamond, rather than the standard 400 eV. A small EDIFF is required to provide converged chemical shifts, e.g. 1E-8 eV. Tighter precision, e.g. PREC = Accurate. Non-spherical contributions to the gradient of the density inside PAW spheres, i.e. LASPH = .TRUE. Structure The structure is extremely important, so using the experimental structure can improve results. Differences of 25 mAngstrom in structure can make a difference of 40 % to {\displaystyle V_{zz}} {\displaystyle V_{zz}}  . PAW pseudopotentials The use of PAW potentials has a strong influence, GW POTCAR files often improve values. Semi-core electrons can be important (check the POSCAR files with *_pv or *_sv ) as well as explicit inclusion of augmentation channels with {\displaystyle d} {\displaystyle d} -projectors.
