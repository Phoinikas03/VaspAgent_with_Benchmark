NELMIN =  Default: NELMIN = 2 Description: NELMIN specifies the minimum number of electronic self-consistency steps. It is rarely necessary to change the value of the NELMIN tag. In some cases, e.g., in molecular-dynamics runs, or ionic-minimization methods, we recommend increasing the NELMIN tag to a value between 4 and 8.
