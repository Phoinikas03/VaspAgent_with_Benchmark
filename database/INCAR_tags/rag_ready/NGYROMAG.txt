NGYROMAG =  Default: NGYROMAG = NTYP*1.0 Description: NGYROMAG specifies the nuclear gyromagnetic ratios (in MHz, for H 0 = 1 T) for the atomic types on the POTCAR file. By means of the NGYROMAG -tag one can specify the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio: where one should specify one number for each of the N species on the POSCAR file. If one does not set NGYROMAG in the INCAR file, VASP assumes a factor of 1 for each species. NGYROMAG is given in units of MHz/T, see Ref.  for a table of different gyromagnetic ratios. A more extensive list is available on  which converts isotopic magnetic moments from Ref.  and converts them using the definition of the gyromagnetic raion defined in Ref.  .
