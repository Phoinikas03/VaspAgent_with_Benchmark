EFIELD =  Description: EFIELD controls the magnitude of the applied electric force field. It is possible to apply an external electrostatic field in slab, or molecular calculations. Presently only a single value can be supplied and the field is applied in the direction selected by IDIPOL =1-4. The electric force field is supplied in units of eV/Angstrom. Dipole corrections to the potential ( LDIPOL =.TRUE.) can and should be turned on to avoid interactions between the periodically repeated images.
