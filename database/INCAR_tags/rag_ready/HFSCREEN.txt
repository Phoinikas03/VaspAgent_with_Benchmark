HFSCREEN =  Default: HFSCREEN = 0 (none) Description: HFSCREEN (in Angstrom -1 ) specifies the range-separation parameter in range-separated hybrid functionals . In case LHFCALC =.TRUE., in combination with PBE potentials (or GGA =PE), attributing a value to HFSCREEN will switch from the PBE0 functional to, e.g., the closely related HSE03 ( HFSCREEN =0.3) or HSE06 ( HFSCREEN =0.2) functionals. It also needs to be set for dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals (DDH) and doubly screened hybrid (DSH) functionals, see LMODELHF .
