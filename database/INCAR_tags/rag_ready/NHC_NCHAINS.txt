NHC_NCHAINS =  Default: NHC_NCHAINS = 0 Description: Length of the Nosé-Hoover chain. NHC_NCHAINS sets the length of the chain for the Nosé-Hoover–chain (NHC) thermostat . Typically, this tag is set to a value between 1 and 5. The maximal allowed value is 20. In case NHC_NCHAINS =0, the thermostat is switched off and the underlying dynamics generate a microcanonical (NVE) ensemble . NHC_NCHAINS =1 corresponds to the standard Nosé-Hoover thermostat .
