ML_OUTPUT_MODE =  Default: ML_OUTPUT_MODE = 1 Description: This tag allows to disable certain file output which helps to increase performance in molecular-dynamics simulations with machine-learned force fields in prediction-only mode ( ML_MODE = run ). This tag is useful in combination with ML_OUTBLOCK to further reduce per-time-step calculations and file output. The following options exist for this tag: ML_OUTPUT_MODE = 1 : Normal operation , output is written as usual in ab-initio molecular-dynamics simulations. ML_OUTPUT_MODE = 0 : Reduced file output mode , in contrast to normal operation the following changes apply: Pair-correlation functions are not computed. No output to PCDAT file. No pair_correlation output section in vaspout.h5 . No structure , varray name="forces" and varray name="stress" output sections in vasprun.xml .
