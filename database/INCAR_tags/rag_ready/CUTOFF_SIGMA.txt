CUTOFF_SIGMA =  (  ) Description: CUTOFF_SIGMA specifies the broadening {\displaystyle \sigma} {\displaystyle \sigma} in eV for the cutoff function specified by CUTOFF_TYPE . Corresponds to a broadening of the cutoff function used in the one-shot method to obtain Wannier functions. The meaning of {\displaystyle \sigma} {\displaystyle \sigma} depends on the CUTOFF_TYPE tag. For spin-polarized calculations ( ISPIN = 2 ), two values can be specified for CUTOFF_SIGMA , one for each spin channel. If only a single value is specified, it will be used for both spin channels.
