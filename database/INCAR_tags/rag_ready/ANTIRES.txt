ANTIRES = 0 | 1 | 2 Default: ANTIRES = 0 Description: ANTIRES determines whether the Tamm-Dancoff approximation is used or not. ANTIRES =0 Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) ANTIRES =1 yields exact results at ω=0 at roughly the same cost as TDA ANTIRES =2 beyond Tamm-Dancoff, coupling between positive and negative frequencies VASP uses the procedures outlined in reference  to include contributions beyond TDA. Beyond-TDA calculations increase the computational time and memory requirements by typically a factor of 2. Related tags and articles BSE calculations Examples that use this tag References
