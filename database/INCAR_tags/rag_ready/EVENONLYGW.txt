EVENONLYGW =  Default: EVENONLYGW = .FALSE. Description: EVENONLYGW allows to restrict the k-points in the evaluation of response functions (in GW calculations ) to even values. EVENONLYGW = .TRUE. is only of limited use and restricts the summation to k-points with {\displaystyle n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}} {\displaystyle n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}} being even ( {\displaystyle \Gamma} {\displaystyle \Gamma} point and from there on every second k-point included).
