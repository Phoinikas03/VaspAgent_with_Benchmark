NBMOD = -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 |  Description: NBMOD controls how bands are selected when computing partial charge densities . NBMOD is used with other tags to define the mode of band selection for partial charge densities in PARCHG , vaspout.h5 , or CHGCAR files. There are several ways to set this tag. NBMOD = n: Use n bands NBMOD = 0: Use all bands NBMOD = -1: Use all occupied bands NBMOD = -2: Use an absolute energy interval to select contributing bands NBMOD = -3: Use an energy interval to select contributing bands and add the Fermi energy {\displaystyle \epsilon_f} {\displaystyle \epsilon_f} to the passed values Related tags and articles LPARD , IBAND , EINT , KPUSE , LSEPB , LSEPK , LPARDH5 , PARCHG , vaspout.h5 , Band-decomposed charge densities Examples that use this tag
