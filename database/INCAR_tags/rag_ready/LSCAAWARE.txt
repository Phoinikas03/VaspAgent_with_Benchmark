LSCAAWARE =  Description: LSCAAWARE controls the distribution of the Hamilton matrix. For LSCAAWARE =.TRUE., VASP distributes the Hamilton matrix among the MPI ranks. For LSCAAWARE =.FALSE., each MPI ranks allocates the complete Hamiltonain. In both cases LSCALAPACK decides if ScaLAPACK routines are used for diagonalization.
