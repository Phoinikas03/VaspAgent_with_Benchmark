NUM_WANN =  Default: NUM_WANN = NBANDS Description: Controls the number of Wannier orbitals to be constructed. This tag is used to determine the number of Wannier orbitals to be constructed in the SCDM method . Since VASP 6.2.0, NUM_WANN also determines the number of Wannier orbitals to be used with wannier90. Note that the num_wann value written to the wannier90.win file is always the value of NUM_WANN known by vasp. When using LOCPROJ for Wannierization, it is not necessary to set NUM_WANN . In this case, the number of Wannier orbitals is automatically set equal to the number of local functions. Related tags and articles LWANNIER90 , LSCDM , CUTOFF_TYPE
