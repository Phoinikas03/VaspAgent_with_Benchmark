LIBMBD_ALPHA =  Description: LIBMBD_ALPHA defines the free-atom polarizabilities {\displaystyle \alpha_{0}} {\displaystyle \alpha_{0}} (bohr {\displaystyle ^{3}} {\displaystyle ^{3}} ) used in the Tkatchenko-Scheffler and Many-body dispersion energy methods as implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . LIBMBD_ALPHA allows to set values for the free-atom polarizabilities {\displaystyle \alpha_{0}} {\displaystyle \alpha_{0}} (bohr {\displaystyle ^{3}} {\displaystyle ^{3}} ) used in the Tkatchenko-Scheffler and Many-body dispersion energy methods as implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods    . For each atom listed in the POSCAR file, a value has to be provided. The values are internally passed to the first column of the libMBD input free_values described at the page  . libMBD is a separate library package that has to be downloaded  and compiled before VASP is compiled with the corresponding precompiler options and links to the libraries .
