EINT =   |  Default: EINT = not set Description: EINT sets the energy interval for bands contributing to the calculation of the partial charge density in eV. EINT =  : EINT = : If  is larger than , the two values will be flipped internally, so a meaningful energy interval is used. If EINT is set, but NBMOD is not, it will be internally set to NBMOD = -2, and the input values of EINT will be treated as absolute energies. EINT can be conveniently used in combination with NBMOD = -3 to mimic the bias-voltage for simulating a scanning-tunneling-microscope image .
