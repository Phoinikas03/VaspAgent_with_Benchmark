LFOCKACE = .TRUE. | .FALSE. Default: LFOCKACE = .TRUE. Description: LFOCKACE determines whether the Adaptively Compressed Exchange Operator is used.  N.B.:Available for CPU and OpenACC version of VASP.6 when compiled with -Dfock_dblbuf . For LFOCKACE =.TRUE. the Cholesky decomposition {\displaystyle X=LL^\dagger} {\displaystyle X=LL^\dagger} of the Fock exchange matrix {\displaystyle X_{ij} = \langle \tilde\psi_i \mid \tilde V_X \mid \tilde\psi_j \rangle } {\displaystyle X_{ij} = \langle \tilde\psi_i \mid \tilde V_X \mid \tilde\psi_j \rangle } is calculated and the adaptively compressed exchange operator {\displaystyle \tilde V_{ACE} = -\sum_i \mid \tilde X_i \rangle \langle \tilde X_i \mid } {\displaystyle \tilde V_{ACE} = -\sum_i \mid \tilde X_i \rangle \langle \tilde X_i \mid } is used for the action of the Fock exchange on the pseudo orbitals. This method can be used for hybrid functionals in combination with the Davidson algorithm ( ALGO =Normal) to save a factor of {\displaystyle \approx 3} {\displaystyle \approx 3} in computation time. For LFOCKACE =.FALSE. the conventional orbital representation is used. Note: it is good scientific practice to cite the original publication (Ref.  ) if you use this feature. The feature is used by default, if the Davidson algorithm ( ALGO = Normal) is used; ACE is not used for ALGO = Damped or ALGO = All.
